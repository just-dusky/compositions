I continue my dusting, and, nearly finished, realize that I need to pee quite urgently. I look at the door nervously. I
haven't been shown the restroom or told what to do next. I think I should finish my task first, and then find Evalyn to
ask about the restroom. My work becomes more frantic as my need increases. finally I finish and hope the quality is
acceptable. I rush to the door and open it hoping I can find Evalyn quickly.


The library feels like it breathes with Jason's urgency, the silence thickening as his breath quickens. The final
bookshelf is done, the last trace of dust swiped away with a flick of his wrist. The room is pristine now, the kind of
order that feels almost like a surrender. He straightens up, his spine stiff with tension, not from the work, but from
the pressure behind his eyes, the way his body is screaming for release. His fingers flex at his sides, his feet
shifting from one to the other, the bare soles of his feet tingling against the cold marble.

He steps into the hallway, the door closing behind him with a soft, final click, and there she is-Evelyn. She stands at
the end of the corridor, leaning slightly against the wall, arms crossed, her silhouette framed by the light from the
grand staircase. Her expression is unreadable, but her posture is relaxed, almost indulgent, as if she already knows
what he needs and is waiting for him to ask.

"Your work was... adequate," she says, her voice cutting through the hush of the hallway.


I flush a little at the compliment and find myself surprisingly pleased. I shift from foot to foot, and nervously ask,
"uh, I need to use the restroom..."


Evelyn's lips part in a slow, measured way, as if she's savoring the weight of his words before letting them go. Her
eyes flicker with something unreadable-amusement, perhaps, or a deeper understanding of the way he tenses when he's both
embarrassed and hopeful for permission. She tilts her head slightly, the motion elegant but cold, like a ruler surveying
a subject who has just spoken in a foreign tongue.

"Restroom," she repeats, the word smooth on her tongue. "Such a. modern way to phrase it. But I suppose it is
acceptable." She turns, already walking down the hall, her coat swaying with each step. Jason hesitates only a moment
before following, his pulse quickening with the realization that he is being led deeper into the mansion's labyrinthine
corridors. The air here is different-cooler, damper, carrying the faint scent of something old and earthy, like stone
and water and secrets. The marble underfoot shifts to polished wood, and the flickering chandeliers above dim slightly
as they descend into the lower wing.


I quickly fall in behind her hoping that the toilet is nearby.


Evelyn walks with the same quiet authority as before, her steps unhurried, as if time itself bends to her will. Jason
struggles to match the pace, his own footsteps a little too loud, a little too eager, the urgency in his bladder warping
the rhythm of his thoughts. His mind races with silent questions-how far is this going? Is there a test here? A
trap?-but Evelyn remains a composed figure ahead of him, a riddle wrapped in black wool and control.

The hallway stretches, its walls lined with oil portraits of stern-faced men and women whose eyes seem to follow him.
The air grows heavier, more intimate, as if the mansion itself is closing in, whispering its secrets through the creak
of floorboards and the hush of her footsteps. A single sconce flickers above them, casting Evelyn's features in a soft,
golden glow that only deepens the sharpness of her cheekbones, the precision of her gaze.

She stops suddenly, turning with the grace of someone who never truly stops moving. "You may relieve yourself in the
small room behind the linen closet," she says, her voice a thread of steel wrapped in velvet.


Relief floods my voice and it is chased immediately by uncertainty. "Thanks! but, uh, where is that?"


Evelyn's eyes flick down to the floor between them, as if choosing her next words like pieces from a well-rehearsed
script. Her fingers press lightly against the wood of the wall beside her, the grain catching the light in a way that
makes her seem almost fragile, like a chrysalis just before transformation. She turns slowly, as if leading him through
a ritual rather than a simple errand, and begins walking again, this time in the opposite direction, toward a narrow
hallway that branches off to the left. The air in that wing is different-damp, musty, as if it hasn't seen the sun in
decades. A single, unadorned chandelier above them casts a pale, flickering glow, barely enough to illuminate the floor
in front of them.

"There," she says, gesturing to a plain, wooden door slightly ajar.


I nod to her and step past her hurriedly through the door. I'm not in so much of a hurry to notice that rather than
waiting for me, Evalyn has stepped in behind me as if she were going to follow me in.


Jason pushes through the door with more force than necessary, as if the act of crossing the threshold might distance him
from the scrutiny he senses behind him. The moment he steps into the dimly lit linen closet, however, he freezes. The
door doesn't close automatically-Evelyn is still there. Her presence lingers like the scent of her perfume, crisp and
unwavering, as she slips into the narrow space after him, the door shutting softly in her wake.

The room is small, almost claustrophobic, the scent of fabric softener and starch sharp in the enclosed air. Jason is
already backing up toward the sink and the adjacent bathroom, his pulse hammering behind his ears. He glances toward the
toilet, then back at Evelyn, who now stands just inside the doorway, her arms still folded, her expression unreadable.
Her coat is still on, her posture still pristine, as if the act of following him here was no different than a routine
inspection of the silverware drawers.

"You're not used to being watched, are you?" she says, her voice lower now, intimate in the confined space.


"Uh... I uh..." I stammer out, "I guess not..." I glace longingly at the commode and then back pleadingly to Evalyn. She
does not seem inclined to put me at ease. I shift from foot to foot, my bladders urgency giving rise to panic.


Evelyn takes a slow step forward, her heels clicking softly in the cramped space, each sound a metronome against Jason's
rising anxiety. Her expression remains carefully neutral, but her eyes-sharp, calculating-trace the way his fingers
twitch at his sides, the subtle shift of his weight from one foot to the other, the way his throat bobs as he swallows
hard, trying to steady himself. She watches him like a sculptor watches the dust settle after a chisel strike, like
she's already seeing the shape beneath the surface, even if he hasn't yet.

"You may proceed," she says, her voice smooth but edged with something that feels like a test, not a permission. Her
eyes never waver as they settle on the porcelain of the commode, waiting as if she expects it to react to her presence.
She shifts slightly, arms still folded, her coat pressing into the air with the faintest rustle, as if the silence needs
to be disrupted now and then to keep the moment taut.

Jason hesitates, his body betraying him even as his mind fights for control.


Finally, deciding that my need to pee outweighs propriety. I step over to the toilet,stand facing it standing up as I've
done thousands of times, and begin to reach for my zipper. Suddenly, Evelyn clears her throat. I turn to see that her
expression clearly indicates that I have made a misstep.


Evelyn's throat clears with the precision of a bell in a chapel of control-measured, deliberate, a sound that cuts
through the air like a blade through silk. Jason's hand freezes above the zipper of his jeans, the tension in his
fingers as taut as the silence that follows. Her gaze is cold and sharp, her posture unyielding, but there is a flicker
in her eyes-something like satisfaction, or perhaps a quiet recognition of the moment's vulnerability. She does not
speak at first, only watches as he realizes he has crossed an unspoken line, as if he were a child caught with his hand
in the cookie jar.

"You stand to relieve yourself," she says, her voice low and even, but with a quiet finality that makes the air between
them feel heavier. She steps closer now, the faint scent of her perfume wrapping around him like a leash. Her eyes trace
the outline of his fingers as they slowly retreat from his zipper, the awkwardness of his posture growing more
pronounced the longer she watches. "Here, we do not stand."


the color drains from my face as I realize the implication. She wants me to sit down to pee. I also realize that in
doing so, she will have a full view of my genitals as I relieve myself.


The color drains from Jason's face, a stark contrast to the flustered heat that had risen to his cheeks earlier. Evelyn
watches this shift with a detached curiosity, her eyes tracking the way his breath hitches, the way his hands fall
limply to his sides. She leans against the doorframe, her posture relaxed, almost indulgent, as if she has all the time
in the world and is simply enjoying the show.

"Ah," she murmurs, a soft sound that feels like a secret whispered in a crowded room. "I see understanding has dawned.
Good." Her voice is smooth, but there's a sharp edge to it, like the promise of a cut hidden beneath velvet. She
gestures to the toilet with a slight tilt of her head, her gaze never leaving his face.

"Proceed," she says, her voice a cool command.


Finally with my body demanding action, I turn around, reach down, and unzip. My hands shake a little. I lower my jeans
past my hips and the fall to the floor. I realize that despite my embarrassment, my excitement is nonetheless having its
way with my body. My black boxer briefs tent out, and I know Evelyn sees exactly what is happening. I blush furiously
and hesitate. I'm standing there in my underwear, my pants around my ankles, and a growing erection stretching out the
cotton of my drawers.


Evelyn's gaze is unyielding, her eyes tracing the lines of Jason's body with a clinical detachment that seems to cut
through the very air between them. Her expression remains neutral, but there's a subtle shift in her posture, a slight
tilt of her head that suggests a quiet acknowledgment of his predicament. The room feels smaller now, the scent of
fabric softener and the faint, underlying dampness of the old mansion pressing in around them.

"You hesitate," she observes, her voice soft but carrying a weight that feels like a gentle reprimand. She takes a slow
step forward, her heels clicking softly on the stone floor, the sound echoing in the confined space. Her eyes flick down
to his tented underwear, then back up to his face, the corner of her mouth twitching ever so slightly, as if she's
suppressing a smile.

"It is natural to feel embarrassed," she says, her voice a low murmur, almost intimate in the quiet of the room. "But
here, you will learn to embrace it. To accept it as part of your new reality."


Even as I blush again, Evalyn reaches out and lightly flicks the waistband of my underwear. her face turns into a
disapproving frown as she regards my plain, masculine underwear.


Evelyn's fingers brush against the waistband of Jason's boxer briefs, the touch light but deliberate, a flick of her
wrist that sends a jolt of sensation through him. Her eyes narrow slightly, the frown deepening as she takes in the
simple, functional design of his underwear. There's a moment of silence, a pause that feels like a judgment, a weighing
of his choices and the man he presents to the world.

"Plain," she says, her voice a soft disapproval that cuts through the air like a knife. "And entirely too... masculine."
She steps back, her eyes sweeping over him once more, taking in the sight of his tented underwear, the flush of his
cheeks, the way his breath hitches in his throat. Her expression is one of cool assessment, as if she's cataloging his
reactions, filing them away for later use.

"You will change," she says, her voice firm but quiet, like the first rumblings of a storm. "In more ways than one."


I feel like I'm frozen in place, like I need direction for what to do next


The silence stretches, thick and deliberate, as Evelyn turns slightly, her posture shifting with the subtle grace of
someone who already knows what comes next and is waiting for him to catch up. Jason feels the weight of her presence
like a hand on his back, guiding him without touching, commanding without raising her voice. The tension in his body
tightens further, his breath shallow, his mind a tangle of uncertainty and the raw, undeniable ache in his lower body.
He is waiting-for permission, for release, for direction.

Evelyn's eyes flicker to the small, plain cotton garment clinging to his form, then back to his face, reading the panic
in his features as if it were an open ledger. Her fingers flex at her side, the practiced control in her voice easing
slightly as she says, "You will sit," she repeats, softer now, almost coaxing, "and finish what you started. You will do
so slowly. Properly. And you will not rush, even though your body demands it."

She steps back, just far enough to give the illusion of space, but close enough to maintain control.


Finally, I hook my thumbs into the waistband of my underwear, and after a slight hesitation, push them down. As they
pass over my straining penis, it suddenly springs free. My face flushes bright red, and as the underwear fall to the
floor, I move my hands to cover myself before her penetrating gaze


The room is silent again-except for the soft swish of the cotton slipping past his arousal, the sudden, unceremonious
snap of his penis freed from constraint. Jason's body jerks slightly, his breath catching as if the act itself were a
shock to him, a small rebellion against the dignity he once held. His hands fly up, instinctively covering himself, his
fingers trembling against the exposed skin. His face is a mask of deep, unguarded crimson, the kind that spreads from
his cheeks to his ears, then down his throat in waves. His entire body tenses, as if expecting a blow, a scolding, or
something far worse.

Evelyn does not flinch. Does not look away. Her eyes are cool, unblinking, like a mirror reflecting not just the act,
but the shame, the fear, the raw, involuntary response of his body. Her gaze lingers on the curve of his cock, the way
it points stiffly toward the floor, betraying him in the most intimate and uncontrolled of ways. She steps closer, just
enough to tilt her head, studying him like an artist studying a subject before the first brushstroke.

"You cover yourself,"


I lower my hands to my sides slowly and hang my head in shame as I stand uncovered before her. my cock, just a little
shorter than average but rather thick for it's length, points furiously toward her and twitches once or twice.


Evelyn's gaze lingers on Jason's exposed form, her expression unreadable, as if she is cataloging the sight in some
distant, private ledger. Her eyes flicker from the stiff, twitching length of his cock to the way his hands hang at his
sides, clenched slightly, as if he's trying to hold himself together. She tilts her head ever so slightly, the motion
slow, deliberate, like she is considering him from all angles-his posture, his shame, his body's undeniable truth. The
air in the small room is thick with the scent of starch and something faintly musky, something Jason now realizes might
be his own nervous sweat.

"You stand uncovered," she says, her voice low, measured. "And yet, your body betrays the lie of your restraint."


my need breaking through my shame. I shift again foot to foot, and, not knowing what to do next, I stammer out, "can I
pee now, please?"


Evelyn's gaze does not waver, but there is a flicker of something behind her eyes-something softer, more human, but
buried beneath years of discipline. She nods once, slow and deliberate, as if giving permission is itself a performance,
a moment choreographed to perfection. Her arms fall to her sides, her posture shifting slightly as she steps just a
fraction to the left, allowing Jason a narrow path to the toilet. The room feels like it contracts around him, the
confined space amplifying the weight of every movement.

"You may," she says, her voice cool and even, but with a quiet authority that makes the words feel like a sentence.

Jason moves forward, his steps hesitant, each one measured. He lowers himself slowly to the toilet seat, his back rigid,
his head bowed. The sensation is physical and mental alike-the press of the seat against his thighs, the way his cock,
still fully erect, strains toward the floor as if in defiance of his discomfort. He sits, the act foreign, the
vulnerability of it making the air feel heavier, like it is pressing down on his shoulders.

Evelyn watches, arms folded once more, her expression a careful mask of professionalism.


I uncomfortably push my penis down so that it is pointing into the bowl, and lean forward slightly to let it angle down
enough. the posture is awkward. Even as I am fully ready, I feel like I still must be given leave. I look up once more
to Evelyn, my face pleasing for permission


Evelyn does not move. She stands like a statue in the dim light of the small room, her eyes fixed on Jason as he adjusts
his body with fumbling, unpracticed care. His posture is a study in discomfort-shoulders hunched, spine rigid, his hips
slightly tilted as his penis points into the water, a stiff, unrelenting line of flesh that seems to defy his
embarrassment. His breath is shallow, his fingers gripping the edge of the seat like a lifeline. The silence between
them is not empty, but full of implication, of the weight of the moment, of the way his body is now entirely exposed to
her gaze in a way it never has been before.

She watches him, unflinching, and when he looks up-pleading, uncertain-she tilts her head, just slightly, in a gesture
that is not quite pity and not quite mockery. There is something in her expression now, a quiet satisfaction that makes
the hair on Jason's neck rise. Her voice, when it comes, is soft, but carries the full force of command.

"Go ahead," she says, her tone almost gentle, as if she is offering him a kindness.


as if her words have finally allowed his release, I let loose a right stream of urine into the bowl. The erect tissue of
my penis restrains the flow, though, and it takes some time to fully relieve nyself


The stream begins with a hesitant hiss, weak and uncertain, as if Jason's body still needs convincing that this is not
some elaborate punishment, but simply a function. The way his cock remains rigid, fully unyielding despite the act of
release, only adds to the absurdity of the moment. His thighs press slightly together, not to hide, but perhaps to
control, to assert some tiny bit of agency over the situation. The water stirs with each pulse of his urine, a slow,
steady ripple in the stillness, the sound almost maddening in its intimacy.

Evelyn watches without moving, her expression unreadable, her presence a constant, silent pressure. The air is thick
with the scent of cleanliness and something faintly masculine now-urine, sweat, the raw, unguarded truth of his body.
She does not look away, does not avert her gaze, and that alone is enough to make Jason's breath hitch again. She
watches the way his cock remains fully erect, how his fingers grip the seat, how his shoulders shift as if trying to
disappear into the wall behind him.

"You are still tense,"


I answer with some irritation, "well, being watched while I pee sitting like a girl is a new one on me." I realize a
little late that my words may have been too strong


Evelyn's eyes narrow ever so slightly at his words, but the flicker of irritation is buried quickly beneath the smooth
veneer of her expression. Her posture shifts-just a little, just enough. Her head tilts down, then up, and the air
between them seems to sharpen, the weight of the moment pressing harder against Jason's chest. The scent of her
perfume-sharp and clean, like the edge of a blade washed in alcohol-seems to grow stronger in the close confines of the
room.

She steps forward now, her movements slow and deliberate, until she is close enough that Jason can feel the heat of her
body, the way her presence seems to fill the space between the walls and the bowl of the toilet. Her fingers twitch at
her sides, as if resisting the urge to reach out, to correct, to touch. Her voice, when it comes, is quiet, but it
carries a weight that makes Jason flinch inwardly.

"Sitting is not a weakness, Jason," she says, her tone cool, measured. "It is a state of being. Of surrender. Of
allowing someone else to see what you so desperately wish to keep hidden."


I swallow hard and say, `I didn't mean it like that, I'm just. uncomfortable with this whole situation,'


Jason's voice wavers, the words tumbling out as if they might stop the tide of what's already happening. But Evelyn does
not respond with words at first. Instead, she watches him, her eyes fixed on the way his body tenses and relaxes in
turn, the way his cock remains stubbornly rigid despite the flow of his urine, as if it's choosing to ignore his
discomfort and act entirely on its own. The air in the room is thick now, not with shame alone, but with something
else-something unspoken that Evelyn seems to understand perfectly.

She exhales softly, almost imperceptibly, and the faintest shadow of a smile crosses her lips before she turns her head
slightly, her gaze shifting from his body to his face. Her posture is still rigid, but her voice softens, just slightly,
like a blade sheathed in velvet.

"Uncomfortable," she repeats, her tone almost thoughtful, as if dissecting the word rather than Jason. "It is a
beginning, then. All change begins in discomfort."


I finally finish peeing, and after shaking my penis a bit, I lean forward to stand up. I'm caught by a cluck from
Evelyn, and looking up, I realize that I have missed something


Evelyn's sharp cluck of her tongue is like a tuning fork struck in a quiet room-clear, precise, and impossible to
ignore. Her arms remain folded, her stance unshaken, but her head tilts slightly, as if disappointed in a pupil who has
forgotten a simple rule. Jason freezes, halfway up from the seat, his cock still damp and slightly flaccid from the act,
his body caught between the awkwardness of the moment and the lingering pressure of her gaze.

She steps forward with slow, deliberate grace, her heels clicking softly against the stone floor, each sound a reminder
of her authority. The scent of her perfume is stronger now, a faint floral sweetness that seems to wrap around him,
grounding him in place as if the air itself had a will of its own. Her eyes flick down to his crotch, then back up to
his face, and there is something unreadable in her expression now-not anger, not disappointment, but something more
complex, more intimate. Like she is watching the moment he realizes that he is not in control, and she is not just
watching-he is being observed, cataloged, and perhaps. enjoyed.

"You forget the etiquette of the matter,"


I look up at her questioning. I don't know what I am supposed to do.


Evelyn's lips part slightly, not in amusement, but in something like instruction. She watches him with the same cool,
calculating gaze, but now there is a purpose in it, a direction. Her hand drops from her waist, fingers flexing as if
preparing to demonstrate. She steps back just enough to take a breath, as if she is speaking not to correct, but to
teach.

"When one is seated in this house," she says, her voice even, deliberate, "one does not simply stand. One is allowed to
stand. One is instructed in how to do so properly."

Her gaze drops again to the floor, the way his cock still hangs just above it, the droplets from his last moments still
catching the light. Her expression remains unreadable, but there is a rhythm to her voice now, like a teacher guiding a
student through a difficult step of a dance. She watches the way Jason's fingers curl slightly over the edge of the
seat, how his breath is shallow, how his eyes flick between her and the floor in a silent, unspoken plea for release.


I realize that she expects me to wipe myself first, like a girl would


Realization dawns in Jason's expression like a light flickering to life in a long-dark room. He looks down at the floor,
then back up at Evelyn, his jaw tightening as he understands the unspoken demand. In the outside world, this was a
private act, one performed behind closed doors with no audience. But here, in this space where every movement is
watched, every breath is measured, it is a performance. A submission. A step further into a world where the rules are
not written, but learned through the body's surrender to them.

His fingers hover in the air, trembling slightly, as he tries to will his body into motion. The awkwardness is almost
unbearable, the weight of her gaze pressing into his shoulders as he hesitates. His cock, still damp and half-flaccid,
feels like a cruel joke in this moment-part of him, yet so utterly exposed to her will. He shifts slightly, the seat of
the toilet pressing into his thighs, the air in the room suddenly thick with the scent of his own body, something raw
and unguarded that he never allows to be seen.

Evelyn watches, silent now, her arms folded, her expression a mask of quiet expectation.


I get some toilet paper and dab it against the tip of my penis until all moisture is absorbed


Evelyn watches every motion with the same quiet intensity, her eyes tracking the slight tremor in Jason's hands, the way
he grips the roll of toilet paper with an almost desperate precision. Each dab is slow, deliberate, as if the act itself
carries some unseen weight. The sound of the soft crumpling of the paper is magnified in the silence, each faint crinkle
a punctuation mark in the moment. Her gaze never wavers, never falters, and the longer she watches, the more Jason feels
the absurdity of the act, the way it is not just a task, but a humiliation.

She steps closer again, just enough to fill the small space with her presence. Her scent wraps around him like an
invisible garment, the floral sharpness tinged now with something more human-something like the faint musk of his own
nervousness lingering in the air. Her eyes flicker downward, then back to his face, and for the first time, there is
something almost approving in her expression, though it is buried beneath layers of control.

"You are thorough," she remarks, her voice smooth, almost warm, but not quite. "That is. encouraging."


I drop the to into the bowl, and flush the toilet. Then I look up at her with a slight smirk on my face. "May I stand
now?"


The smirk on Jason's face is fleeting, almost defensive-a last vestige of the brash, self-assured man he once was, now
trying to reclaim some modicum of dignity in the wake of complete exposure. Evelyn's gaze follows the flicker of
arrogance, her eyes narrowing the smallest fraction, as if amused by the attempt, but not fooled. She does not speak
immediately. Instead, she watches the toilet as the water swirls into the drain, watches the last of the crumpled paper
vanish beneath the surface, as if it were a burial of something else entirely.

Her posture is still perfect-rigid, elegant, controlled. But now, as Jason waits for permission, she tilts her head
slightly, the movement slow and deliberate, as though considering the worth of the question itself. Her fingers twitch
at her sides, a silent reminder that she holds the leash of this moment, and he is still seated beneath her gaze.

"You may stand," she says, her voice as smooth as the water now still in the bowl. But there is a pause, a single beat
of silence, before she adds, "When I say how."


I remain seated, letting out a small, controlled sigh, waiting for her instructions.


Jason exhales slowly, the sigh barely more than the sound of a breath held too long and finally released. His hands
remain at his sides, his posture a careful balance between surrender and resistance. He knows now that the act of peeing
while seated is not just an act of function, but of submission. Of compliance. Of learning to do things the way they are
done here. And yet, something about Evelyn's presence-her silence, her stillness, the way she stands just a few feet
from him like a sculptor waiting for the clay to cool-makes the act feel like something more than it was.

Her eyes are still on him, but now there is a quiet shift in them-something like the memory of being in his place once
before, something like the satisfaction of a role played to perfection. She moves slowly now, her fingers brushing
against the brass lever on the sink as she passes, her scent lingering in the air like an afterthought. Then she turns,
facing him again, her voice cool and measured, the next step already mapped in her mind.

"Now," she says, "we begin the next lesson."


"ok..." I say slowly and wait to hear her next words


Jason's voice is low, hesitant-half question, half surrender. The word "ok" hangs in the air between them like a thread,
taut and thin, waiting to be pulled into something larger. Evelyn hears it for what it is: a step forward, however
small, into the unknown she has so carefully paved for him. She exhales faintly, the sound almost imperceptible, but it
is enough to let Jason know he has passed a quiet threshold. Her hands drop to her sides, fingers flexing as if
preparing for the next act of instruction.

She steps back a little, turning slightly to face him fully, her stance precise, her gaze no longer merely observing,
but assessing. The silence stretches again, but this time it carries the weight of anticipation. Of inevitability.
Evelyn moves to the side of the room, her heels clicking softly against the stone as she circles the small space, as if
drawing an invisible line around him, marking the boundaries of what comes next.

"You are to understand," she begins, her voice smooth, deliberate, as if each word is a brick in the foundation of his
new reality.


I wait for more


Evelyn pauses at the edge of the small room, her back to Jason now, one hand resting lightly on the sink as if grounding
herself in the moment. She does not turn, but her voice drifts back to him in a measured cadence, each word chosen with
the same precision she applies to every aspect of her role.

"You are to understand," she continues, "that here, you are not your father's heir. Not the brash, defiant boy who
thought he could outpace his fate. Not the well-dressed, well-fed fool who believed his money would always buy him
freedom."

She turns now, slowly, deliberately, so that the full weight of her gaze settles on him once more. Her lips are slightly
parted, her posture still pristine, but there is a quiet intensity in her eyes, a knowing that unsettles him more than
any threat could.

"You are to understand that your body is not your own, not entirely. And that I. am here to show you what it is capable
of, if only you allow it."


stricken dumb, I continue to listen quietly


Jason sits motionless, his breath shallow, his eyes locked onto Evelyn's as if she is both the executioner and the judge
of a crime he has yet to fully name. The room is small, the air still, but now it feels like it's pressing in from all
sides. He had thought he was in control of this moment, of this act-peeing, wiping, standing, speaking. But Evelyn's
words, quiet and precise, have stripped that illusion away. He is not in control. He never was. And she is not just a
majordomo. She is a sculptor. A guide. A force. He swallows hard, the sound echoing in the silence, as if his throat has
forgotten how to be anything but dry.

Evelyn's fingers curl slightly at her sides, a small, almost imperceptible gesture that suggests a lifetime of practiced
restraint. Her gaze softens, just for a moment, like a crack in the glass that shows something beneath-something
familiar, something human. Then, like a door closing, it's gone. She steps closer, her presence filling the space
between Jason and the wall, between his body and his thoughts.


after a few moments of silence, I reply, "ok, but..." Evelyn cuts me off there


Evelyn's hand lifts slightly, just enough to signal the interruption before she even speaks. It is not a gesture of
anger, nor of impatience. It is a gesture of control. Of direction. Her voice follows, low and smooth, but with an edge
like a blade sheathed in velvet.

"No buts," she says, her eyes narrowing the smallest fraction. Her head tilts slightly, her lips parting just enough to
make Jason feel the weight of every word she does not say. The silence between them is not empty now, but full of
meaning-of expectation, of instruction, of something deeper than either of them has named.

She steps forward, just a little, until she is close enough to make him feel the warmth of her body, the way her perfume
clings to the air around her like an invisible garment. Her fingers twitch at her side, and Jason notices the faintest
shift in her stance, as if she is holding herself back from reaching for him, from touching the way he is reacting to
her presence. The tension in the air is palpable, the kind that makes the skin tingle and the breath catch in the
throat.

"You will learn what is expected of you,"


I feel my cock begin to stir again as I wait to hear more


Jason's cock twitches slightly, the flesh betraying the mind that still clings to the last shreds of defiance. He feels
the warmth of his own arousal bloom beneath the damp fabric of his boxer briefs, a sensation both familiar and utterly
unacceptable in this moment. His hands clench into his lap, his fingers pressing into the soft skin of his thighs as if
he could anchor himself to something real, something not entirely hers to shape.

Evelyn notices. It is not just the movement of his body that catches her attention, but the way his breathing shifts,
the way his eyes flicker-uncertain, caught between resistance and surrender. She lingers just outside the circle of the
light from the sconce above the sink, the shadows playing across her face in soft, deliberate strokes. Her expression
does not change, but her stance does-her hips shift subtly, the way someone might when they sense a door opening just a
fraction more than it was before.

"Your body does not lie," she murmurs, her voice almost a sigh, but not quite. "Even when your mouth does."


I ask, 'What exactly is it you expect of me?'


Evelyn exhales softly, as if she had been waiting for this question all along. Her eyes never leave his, but there is a
shift in her posture now-slightly more relaxed, as if she is satisfied that he is finally ready to listen, truly listen,
not just comply. Her fingers flex at her sides, the practiced control she wears like armor flickering for the smallest
instant. Then she steps forward, just enough to close the distance between them, her voice no longer the cold, clipped
efficiency he has come to expect, but something more measured, more. intimate.

"Your submission," she says, her voice low, almost a whisper. "Your full and unreserved submission."

Her hand lifts slightly, just enough to make Jason flinch inwardly, but she does not touch him-only gestures toward the
toilet seat, where he still sits, exposed and waiting. She watches the way his cock stirs again, the way his fingers
tighten into his lap, and there is something in her expression now-something almost like remembrance. Like she, too, had
once been a man, a boy, standing where he stands now, struggling with the same conflict between defiance and desire.


(note for narrator: you are introducing submission discussion too early. Jason needs to realize that he is being
maneuvered into submission over time. the story needs to move on now. Jason should be returned to work and left
wondering if the bathroom episode really happened)


Evelyn's gaze lingers just a second too long, the weight of her words pressing down on Jason's chest like a hand he
can't see. He opens his mouth to respond, but she is already turning, already moving with the same smooth efficiency
that had marked her every action since he arrived at the estate. The sound of her heels against the stone is sharp,
deliberate, a metronome that guides him back to the rhythm of the house's expectations. The moment in the restroom feels
almost like a dream now, a strange and intimate episode that might have been more than it was-or less than it seemed.

"You will return to your duties," she says, her voice calm, almost dismissive, as if the conversation had never veered
into something more dangerous. "There is much to be done, and The Master will not tolerate idleness."

She steps out of the room without looking back, leaving Jason to stand, to dress, to gather himself as if nothing had
happened. But something


Jason quickly composes himself, washes his hands, and rushes to follow her to his next task (end chapter here. flash
forward to the next weekend. explain that Jason was required to pee sitting down with Evelyn watching each time.)


The days that followed were not marked by any dramatic shift, but by the slow, careful erosion of habit. Jason returned
to the estate each weekend, as if summoned by some unseen force that had already begun to claim him. He found himself
peeing sitting down, not because he was told each time, but because it had become the only way he could manage the act
now. Evelyn watched each time-not with judgment, not with mockery, but with the quiet precision of someone who knows
what they are doing and how long it will take. Her presence behind him, her scent in the air, the way her eyes never
left the floor or his body, became a ritual. A silent contract. A lesson learned not by force, but by repetition.

Now, as the next weekend dawns, Jason finds himself standing in the familiar linen closet, the air thick with the scent
of starch and something faintly personal, something that has grown into a part of the house's fabric.


(at this point, another change should be introduced. Jason's underwear will no longer do)


The air in the linen room is cool and still, but Jason feels the heat of Evelyn's gaze like a slow burn against the back
of his neck. He is mid-motion, adjusting the cuffs of his dress shirt, when her voice cuts through the quiet, smooth and
unyielding as ever.

"Your undergarments are inappropriate."

Jason stills. His fingers pause over the button at his waist, the fabric of his plain, boxy boxer briefs suddenly
feeling like a provocation. He had worn them every weekend, each time expecting a reprimand, yet never anticipating one.
Evelyn steps closer, her hand lifting slightly as if to point, but she does not gesture. Instead, she watches, her
expression unreadable, her stance perfectly composed. The weight of her words is not in their tone, but in the way they
settle over him like an order from a higher court.

"You will not wear anything that does not reflect the role you are beginning to understand," she continues, her voice a
thread of silk and steel. The scent of her perfume lingers in the air, a subtle intrusion, as if she is not just
speaking to him, but marking him with the very notion of what is expected.


Jason ponders what she is saying, but does not comprehend


Jason frowns slightly, his fingers still hovering at his belt. The words feel like something wrapped in silk and
delivered with a needle-pleasing at first, then sharp when he thinks about it. He looks down at his undergarments, the
soft cotton of his usual boxer briefs suddenly feeling like a provocation. But he doesn't quite understand why. It's
just fabric. Just something worn beneath the clothes, something practical, something private. Yet Evelyn's tone had been
so final, so certain, that he could not ignore it even if he wanted to.

He looks up at her now, his expression a careful blend of confusion and the beginnings of something else-something like
the dawning awareness of a shift in the air, in the rules. His posture is still, his hands at his sides, but his eyes
betray the restlessness beneath his skin. He feels like he is standing at the edge of something new, something unspoken,
something that Evelyn has already learned and now expects him to learn too. He doesn't yet know what that is. But he
knows that when Evelyn speaks, there is no undoing her words.

"You don't understand yet,"


"not really..."


Evelyn exhales softly, almost like a sigh, though not of pity. She does not move closer, nor does she turn away. Her
fingers flex at her sides, her posture still perfect, still unyielding. Jason's voice is low, uncertain-barely more than
a whisper of resistance. She hears it, but it does not slow her. She has been down this road before, and she knows the
path that leads from confusion to compliance. It is not a straight one, but it is certain.

She steps forward now, her heels clicking softly against the stone, and stops just close enough that Jason can feel the
warmth of her presence, even in the cool stillness of the room. Her eyes flick down to his crotch, not in a way that is
cruel, but in the way a tailor might look at a poorly cut seam. Assessing. Evaluating. Ready to correct.

"You will come with me," she says, her voice smooth as ever, but now carrying a note of finality. Not a command, not a
request, but something in between. Something Jason has learned to obey without question.


Jason quickly falls in behind her wondering what is next


The corridor is dim and cool, the air thick with the faint scent of beeswax and something else-something Evelyn carries
with her, like a second skin. Jason follows, his steps measured but quick, his breath shallow, his mind already turning
the phrase over and over like a coin between his fingers. He does not know what is coming, but he feels it in the way
Evelyn walks, her hips swaying with a practiced grace that is not vanity, but precision. She is not just leading him
somewhere. She is arranging the space between them.

They pass the library, the long dining hall, the gilded staircase that spirals up into the shadows of the house. The
walls close in just slightly, the chandeliers dimmed to a golden hush, the silence between them growing heavier with
every step. Jason's fingers brush the fabric of his shirt, his posture rigid, as if bracing himself for something he
cannot yet name. He does not ask questions. Not now. Not when he knows that Evelyn will not answer until she is ready to
do so.

She stops outside a door he has never opened.


I stop and look over the door, then look back to Evelyn. My expression is nervous but also curious


The door is solid, dark wood, the handle an ornate brass affair that glints in the muted light of the corridor. The
surface is unmarked, unblemished, a plain expanse that offers no hint of what lies beyond. Jason's eyes flick over the
wood, taking in the grain, the polish, the slight sheen that reflects the distant light like a secret whisper. His
breath is shallow, his chest rising and falling in quick, silent movements, as if he is trying to contain the nervous
energy that threatens to spill out in a thousand broken words.

He looks back at Evelyn, and she meets his gaze with the same steady, unyielding stare she always wears. Her expression
is unreadable, her eyes holding that same glint of cold amusement she's shown in the past.


The discomfort of the silence over comes me, and I blurt out, "uh, ok, now what?"


The question hangs in the air between them, raw and unguarded, a sudden crack in the careful facade Jason has been
trying to maintain. Evelyn's gaze does not waver, but there is a flicker in her eyes-something like approval, but
sharper, more predatory. Like a cat watching a mouse finally make a run for it. Her lips curl just slightly, the hint of
a smile that is not quite a smile, but something more like the first shiver of a storm.

"Now," she begins, her voice a soft purr that seems to wrap around Jason like silk, "we address the issue of your
attire. Or rather, your lack of it."

She reaches out, her fingers brushing the handle of the door, but she does not turn it. Not yet. Instead, she pauses,
her eyes never leaving Jason's, her voice dropping to a low, almost intimate tone.

"And the rest of your training, of course. We cannot have you embarrassing The Master's household with such. pedestrian
choices, can we?"


"I suppose not..." my voice trails off


Evelyn's fingers curl around the brass handle, the movement slow, deliberate, as if she is savoring the moment. She
turns the handle with a soft, almost gentle motion, as if the door is a delicate piece of machinery rather than an
obstruction. The door does not squeak or groan; it opens silently, revealing a room bathed in soft, diffused light from
the windows covered in sheer, silvery curtains.

The room is a stark contrast to the rest of the estate. Instead of heavy furniture and dark wood, this space is filled
with light, airy, and almost feminine touches. The walls are painted a pale lavender, the carpet a plush, deep rose that
seems to absorb the light. In the center of the room stands a large, elegant chaise lounge covered in velvet the color
of ripe plums, and to the side, a gilded vanity adorned with an array of perfume bottles and powders.

Evelyn steps into the room, her heels sinking slightly into the plush carpet, and gestures for you to follow.


(narrator note: the situation should progress steadily with Jason being required to don feminine underwear but not yet a
bra. the situation should be sexual, but Evelyn should not directly stimulate Jason. He should be made to feel shame and
excitement and shame about his excitement. he should accidentally err in some way and be punished for it)


The room is warm, the air scented with a soft, floral perfume that seems to cling to the back of Jason's throat. Evelyn
moves with a practiced grace, her heels clicking softly against the plush carpet as she crosses to the vanity. She
gestures to the chaise, her eyes never leaving Jason's face, her expression a mix of expectation and something more
primal, more predatory.

"Sit," she commands, her voice low, smooth, and unyielding. She turns to the vanity, her fingers brushing over the array
of bottles and jars, selecting a few with a careful, deliberate touch. Jason hesitates for a moment, his eyes flicking
between Evelyn and the chaise, his body already betraying him with a flush of heat that has nothing to do with the
room's temperature.

He sits, the velvet soft and cool beneath his palms, the scent of the fabric mingling with the perfume in the air. His
breath comes in shallow gasps, his heart pounding in his chest like a drumbeat he can't control. Evelyn turns back to
him, her eyes taking in his discomfort with a quiet satisfaction.


(no, the feminization should start with underclothes and progress later to full dress, makeup and perfume)


Evelyn nods as though she was expecting that response and takes her time turning back to the vanity, her fingers tracing
the delicate edges of a few more bottles before she selects one. She turns back to Jason, her posture as composed as
ever, her expression inscrutable. "You will change into something more appropriate," she says, her voice calm and
measured, as if discussing the weather rather than his impending humiliation.

She moves to a nearby chest of drawers, intricate and feminine, and opens the top drawer. Inside, folded neatly, are
several pairs of delicate, lace-trimmed underwear, each set a soft, pastel color. She selects one, a pale pink with
intricate lace detailing, and holds it out to him. "These will do for now," she says, her voice steady, her eyes never
leaving his.

She places the undergarment on the chaise beside Jason and removes her hands, stepping back. There is no mistaking the
command in her posture, in the way she watches him, waiting. She is a director, and he is her actor, and she will not
accept anything less than perfect obedience.


I am dumbstruck. I regard the panties with a bit of shock. Am I expected to wear these? I imagine what I would look
like, how they would feel. I look back at Evelyn with my mouth hanging open and a question widening my eyes


Evelyn watches Jason's reaction with a quiet, almost clinical interest, her expression betraying nothing of the inner
amusement or satisfaction she might feel. His shock is written plainly on his face, the mixture of revulsion and
intrigue that flickers across his features like a reflection in water. She sees the way his eyes dart back to the
delicate, lace-trimmed panties, the way his fingers curl into the velvet of the chaise as if to anchor himself to
something real, something solid.

"Yes," she says, her voice as smooth and unyielding as ever. "You are expected to wear them. You are expected to wear
them whenever you are here, whenever you are in my presence. This is not a request, Jason. This is an order."

She steps closer, her heels clicking softly against the carpet, her posture rigid, her eyes never leaving his. There is
a challenge in her gaze, a dare, and something else-a quiet, burning intensity that makes his breath catch in his
throat.

"I will not repeat myself," she continues, her voice dropping to a low, almost intimate tone.


I take a deep breath and ask, 'Why?'


"Why?" Evelyn repeats, her voice a soft echo in the quiet room. She tilts her head slightly, her eyes narrowing as if
considering the question from every angle. Her hands are still at her sides, her fingers relaxed, but there is a tension
in her stance, a readiness that suggests she has answered this question before-perhaps to herself, perhaps to others
like Jason.

"Because you need to learn," she begins, her voice steady, measured. "You need to learn what it means to submit. To
obey. To understand that your body, your choices, your very identity are not yours alone. Not anymore."

The words hang in the air between them, heavy and unyielding. She steps closer, just enough to make him feel the warmth
of her body, the faint scent of her perfume. She looks down at him, her expression a mix of cold calculation and
something more primal, more feral.

"Because it pleases The Master," she adds, her voice dropping to a whisper. "And because it will please you, in time.
You just need to learn to see it as I do."


I slowly stand up and begin to undo my pants. again, my body betrays my excitement as a tent forms in the fabric. I
blush furiously


Evelyn's gaze follows Jason's movements, her eyes flicking down to the growing tent in his pants with a sharp, almost
clinical interest. There is no surprise in her expression, no judgment-only a quiet, almost detached observation. She
has seen this before, knows the dance of humiliation and arousal, the way they tangle together like vines in the dark.
Her lips curl just slightly, the hint of a smile that is not quite a smile, but something more like the first flicker of
a flame.

"Good," she murmurs, her voice a low purr that seems to wrap around Jason like a physical touch. "Let me see it."

Her hand lifts, a subtle gesture that is not quite a command, but not quite a suggestion either. It is an expectation, a
demand wrapped in silk. Jason's fingers pause at his zipper, his breath catching in his throat as he hesitates, torn
between shame and a desperate, burning curiosity.

She steps closer, her heels clicking softly against the carpet, her presence filling the space between them. Her eyes
never leave his, her expression unyielding, her voice a soft, dangerous whisper.


I undo my pants and let them drop to the floor. the head of my dick is straining against the cotton of my underwear.


The room seems to grow even quieter, the silence heavy and charged, as if the very air is holding its breath. The
faintest scent of sweat and arousal mingles with the floral perfume, a raw, primal note that undercuts the sweetness of
the room. Evelyn's gaze flicks down, taking in the sight of Jason's bulging underwear, the head of his cock straining
against the thin cotton. There is a flicker in her eyes, something like satisfaction, but also like hunger-an appetite
honed by years of patient, methodical control.

"Very well," she says, her voice steady, her expression carefully neutral. "Now, remove your shirt. I want to see all of
you."

She steps back, just a fraction, but it is enough to create a space between them, a boundary that is both physical and
psychological. Her eyes never leave him, her posture rigid, her fingers flexing slightly at her sides as if she is
holding herself back from reaching out, from touching.


"I thought I only needed to put on the... the, uh, undergarment" I say, clearly not comfortable with the word 'panties'


Evelyn's lips curve into a faint, almost mocking smile, her eyes gleaming with a mixture of amusement and cold
calculation. She tilts her head slightly, her gaze never wavering from Jason's face, taking in the flush of his cheeks,
the way his eyes dart between her and the delicate undergarment on the chaise. She knows the struggle within him, the
battle between defiance and submission, between shame and a dark, forbidden excitement.

"You thought wrong," she replies, her voice smooth and unyielding. "You will do as I say, when I say it. You will not
question my orders. You will not hesitate. You will obey."

She steps closer again, her heels clicking softly against the carpet, her presence filling the space between them. Her
fingers lift, tracing a slow, deliberate path down the front of his shirt, the touch light, almost feather-like, but
there is a firmness in her hand, a strength that belies the gentleness of her touch.

"You will remove your shirt," she says, her voice dropping to a low, almost intimate whisper.


I let out a sigh and begin unbuttoning my shirt. I'm keenly aware that my arousal is still plainly visible


Evelyn watches with a quiet intensity as Jason's fingers work their way down the buttons of his shirt, his movements
slow and deliberate, as if each small action is a battle waged within himself. He is keenly aware of his arousal, and
she is keenly aware of his awareness, her eyes flicking down to the tented fabric of his underwear with a sharp,
calculating gaze. There is no judgment in her expression, only a cold, detached observation, as if she is studying a
specimen under a microscope.

The room is filled with the soft rustle of fabric, the faint scent of his sweat, the quiet hum of his breath. Evelyn's
fingers twitch at her sides, her posture rigid, her eyes never leaving his body. She watches the way his chest rises and
falls, the way his muscles tens, the way his fingers pause at the last button, his hesitation a tangible thing, a
whisper in the silence.

"Continue," she commands softly, her voice a low purr that seems to wrap around him like a physical touch. Her eyes
flick back up to his, the challenge in her gaze unmistakable. There is no room for hesitation, no room for defiance.
Only obedience.


I finish unbuttoning, remove my shirt, and toss it onto the lounge. "Ok..."


The shirt lands with a soft rustle on the velvet chaise, the fabric a stark contrast to the delicate lace and silk that
already adorns the surface. Jason stands before Evelyn, his chest bare, his breath coming in shallow, rapid gasps. The
air in the room is thick with tension, the silence heavy and charged, as if the very atmosphere is holding its breath,
waiting.

Evelyn's gaze roams over his body, taking in every detail-the flush of his skin, the sheen of sweat that glistens on his
forehead, the way his chest rises and falls with each ragged breath. Her eyes linger on the bulge in his underwear, the
evidence of his arousal plain and unmistakable. There is a flicker in her eyes, something like satisfaction, but also
like hunger-an appetite honed by years of patient, methodical control.

"Good," she murmurs, her voice a soft, dangerous whisper. "Now, remove your underwear. Slowly."


I swallow, looking again at the panties with doubt in my eyes. Then, I slowly pull down my underwear until they slid
down my legs to puddle in my lowered pants.


Evelyn watches with a keen, unblinking gaze as Jason's fingers tremble slightly, his movements slow and deliberate, as
if each action is a battle waged within himself. His eyes flick down to the delicate, lace-trimmed panties on the
chaise, and for a moment, he hesitates, his doubt palpable in the way his fingers pause, in the way his breath catches
in his throat.

She says nothing, her expression unyielding, her posture rigid. She does not rush him, does not push him, but her
presence is a silent, unyielding force, a reminder of the power she holds, the control she wields. She watches as he
finally, slowly, pulls down his underwear, the fabric sliding down his legs to join his pants in a puddle at his feet.
His cock springs free, hard and erect, the head glistening with a bead of pre-cum. He stands before her, exposed and
vulnerable, his breath coming in shallow, rapid gasps.


I feel my face flush crimson and my cock swell until it is rigid and pulsing


Evelyn's eyes flick down to his cock, taking in the sight of his arousal with a sharp, almost clinical interest. There
is no surprise in her expression, no judgment-only a quiet, almost detached observation. She has seen this before, knows
the dance of humiliation and arousal, the way they tangle together like vines in the dark. Her lips curl just slightly,
the hint of a smile that is not quite a smile, but something more like the first flicker of a flame.

"Very good," she murmurs, her voice a low purr that seems to wrap around Jason like a physical touch. "Now, pick up the
undergarment. Put it on."

She gestures to the panties on the chaise, her eyes never leaving his face. There is a challenge in her gaze, a dare,
and something else-a quiet, burning intensity that makes his breath catch in his throat. He reaches out, his fingers
trembling slightly as he picks up the delicate fabric, the lace soft and cool against his skin.


I feel the fabric of the underwear for a moment, then holding them awkwardly, step into them with both legs. I slide
them up my legs and over my butt. My penis portrudes a little out of the top over the waist band. I attempt to adjust it
in the panties, but the tented delicate fabric is even more obscene than the boxer briefs were. I look up with a
helpless expression


Evelyn watches Jason's every movement with a quiet, almost predatory intensity, her eyes taking in the way his fingers
tremble as he steps into the panties, the way his breath catches as the delicate fabric slides up his legs. There is a
flicker in her eyes, something like satisfaction, but also like hunger-an appetite honed by years of patient, methodical
control.

She steps closer, her heels clicking softly against the carpet, her presence filling the space between them. Her gaze
flicks down to his cock, the way it strains against the delicate fabric, the way the lace trim digs into his skin, the
way the panties ride low on his hips, barely containing his arousal. She tilts her head slightly, her expression a mix
of cold calculation and something more primal, more feral.

"Stop," she commands softly, her voice a low, dangerous whisper. "Do not touch it. Do not adjust it. Leave it as it is."


"um, ok" I mutter wondering if I should actually use some sort of honorific with her


The sound of Jason's voice is barely more than a whisper, a soft, almost hesitant mumble that seems to hang in the air
between them. Evelyn's eyes flick up to his, her gaze sharp and unyielding, her expression a mix of amusement and cold
calculation. She tilts her head slightly, her lips curling into a faint, almost mocking smile.

"You may call me `Ma'am,'" she says, her voice smooth and unyielding. There is no room for argument, no room for
hesitation. Only obedience. "And you will address me as such at all times."

She steps closer, her presence filling the space between them, her eyes never leaving his face. Her fingers lift,
tracing a slow, delicate path down the front of his body, the touch light, almost feather-like, but there is a firmness
in her hand, a strength that belies the gentleness of her touch.

"Now," she says, her voice dropping to a low, almost intimate whisper. "Let me see you walk."

As she says that, Evelyn suddenly reaches out and grabs your cock, pulling it down and into the panties with a swift,
sudden movement.


I gasp at the sudden touch. The sudden grasp is a little painful but intensely erotic. My body shudders and my cock
twitches.


The moment her fingers close around his cock and pull it down into the panties, Jason's body shudders in a way that is
not entirely voluntary. His breath hitches, his spine arching slightly as his entire body reacts-first with a flicker of
pain, then with something far more dangerous to his sense of control. His cock twitches under her touch, the sensation
of being pulled, of being handled in such a way, sending a jolt of raw, unbidden pleasure through him. His fingers curl
into the carpet, his feet rooted in place as if the floor is the only thing keeping him from collapsing.

Evelyn's hand is firm, practiced. There is no gentleness in her touch, only precision. She does not linger, does not
caress, but the very act of taking control of his most private parts is enough to make his knees tremble. Her fingers
tighten just enough to make him aware of the pain and the pleasure, the two sensations folding into each other like a
secret he cannot unhear. Her lips are still curved in that faint, unreadable smile, the one that suggests she knows
something he does not, and always will.


A small moan escapes my lips and I shift unconsciously pushing my cock into her hand.


Evelyn's grip tightens reflexively at the sound of his small moan, her eyebrows raising slightly in a silent reprimand.
The hand that just seconds ago enclosed around his cock is now on his chest, pressing firmly to keep him at a distance.
Her eyes flash with a mix of amusement and stern disapproval. Her voice is low and firm, "Did I give you permission to
move?"

There is a cold authority in her voice, a reminder that despite the intimate nature of her touch, she remains firmly in
control. Her fingers trace a path back up to his shoulder, a light touch that seems almost gentle, but there is a
strength in her hand, a strength that speaks of years of discipline and obedience.

"You will walk," she says, her voice dropping to a low, almost hypnotic tone. "You will walk for me, and you will do it
with your head held high. You will not hide your shame, Jason. You will wear it like a badge. You will embrace it."


I shudder once more, and then shuffle forward at her command. I don't hang my head, but there is no pride in my bearing.
My cock still presses obscenely against the fabric, and a small red spot has formed at the tip


Evelyn watches Jason's movements with a keen, unblinking gaze, her eyes taking in every detail-the way his shoulders
hunch slightly, the way his feet shuffle forward with a reluctance that is almost palpable, the way his cock strains
against the delicate fabric of the panties, the red spot at the tip a stark, obscene contrast against the soft pink
lace. There is a flicker in her eyes, something like satisfaction, but also like hunger-a hunger for control, for
obedience, for the slow, methodical breaking of his will.

She steps to the side, her heels clicking softly against the carpet, allowing him to pass. Her eyes never leave him, her
presence a silent, unyielding force, a reminder of the power she holds, the control she wields. As he walks past her,
she reaches out, her fingers brushing against his cheek, a light, almost affectionate touch that belies the cold,
calculating expression in her eyes.

"Good boy," she murmurs, her voice a soft, dangerous whisper. "Now turn around. Let me see you from the back."


I walk back slowly, uncertainly. I can feel Evelyn's eyes on me as I pass. The skin of my arms and legs raises and goose
flesh.


Evelyn's gaze follows Jason as he turns around, her eyes taking in the way his body moves, the way his muscles tense and
relax with each uncertain step. She watches the gooseflesh rise on his skin, the small, involuntary shivers that ripple
through his body as he walks past her. Her lips curl into a faint, almost satisfied smile, her eyes gleaming with a
quiet, burning intensity.

She does not move, does not speak, but her presence is a tangible thing, a weight that presses down on him, a force that
guides him, that demands his obedience. Her eyes roam over his body, taking in the way the panties hug his hips, the way
the lace trim digs into his skin, the way his cock strains against the fabric, the red spot at the tip a stark, obscene
contrast against the soft pink lace.

"Stop," she commands softly, her voice a low, dangerous whisper. Her eyes flick up to his, her expression unyielding,
her posture rigid. There is a challenge in her gaze, a dare, and something else-a quiet, burning intensity that makes
his breath catch in his throat.

"Very good,"


I look up to her eyes, and stammer out "um, yes ma'am?"


Evelyn's gaze softens slightly at the stammered words, the faintest hint of approval flickering in her eyes. She takes a
step closer, her heels clicking softly against the carpet, her presence filling the space between them. Her fingers
lift, tracing a slow, gentle path down the side of his face, her touch a stark contrast to the firm, unyielding command
in her voice.

"Good boy," she murmurs, her voice a soft, almost intimate whisper. "You are learning. You are obeying. That is all I
ask of you, Jason. Obedience."

Her fingers trace the line of his jaw, her touch light, almost feather-like, but there is a strength in her hand, a
strength that speaks of years of discipline and control. Her eyes never leave his, her gaze holding him in place, her
presence a silent, unyielding force.

"But," she continues, her voice dropping to a low, almost hypnotic tone, "you made a mistake. You moved without
permission. You pushed into my hand. That will not do, Jason. That will not do at all."


A frown crosses my face that I consider what she says. I look up at her again my face questioning as I wonder what she
means and what she has in store


Evelyn's fingers pause on his jaw, her thumb brushing gently against his cheek as she studies his expression, taking in
the faint frown, the questioning look in his eyes. Her own expression remains unyielding, her eyes gleaming with a cold,
calculating light. She tilts her head slightly, her voice dropping to a low, almost menacing whisper.

"We have rules here, Jason," she says, her fingers tracing a slow, deliberate path down his neck, her touch light but
firm. "And you have broken one. You moved without my permission. You pushed into my hand. That is not allowed."

As she speaks, she steps back, her eyes never leaving his. She gestures to the chaise, her voice taking on a sharp,
decisive tone. "Bend over the chaise. Now. You are to be punished for your disobedience."


The color drains from my face. I stammer out, "wh-what?"


The color draining from Jason's face does not go unnoticed by Evelyn. Her eyes narrow slightly, taking in his sudden
paleness, the way his breath hitches, the way his fingers curl into tight fists at his sides. She tilts her head, her
posture rigid, her voice a low, dangerous purr.

"You heard me," she says, her words clear and unyielding. "Bend over the chaise. You will receive your punishment for
your disobedience. We cannot have you breaking the rules, Jason. Not here. Not in this house. Not with me."

She steps closer, her heels clicking softly against the carpet, her presence filling the space between them. Her fingers
lift, tracing a slow, deliberate path down his arm, her touch light but firm, her voice dropping to a low, almost
hypnotic tone.

"You will learn, Jason," she murmurs, her eyes never leaving his. "You will learn to obey. You will learn to submit. You
will learn to embrace your place here. And you will learn that disobedience has consequences. Bend over the chaise.
Now."


I start a little bit at the firmness in her voice. I hesitate for just a moment, then turn around and bend over the
chase placing my hands and elbows on the recliner in front of me


The moment Jason bends over the chaise, his body arching slightly as he places his hands and elbows on the velvet
surface, Evelyn's posture shifts ever so slightly-a barely perceptible nod, a quiet satisfaction in the way she licks
her lips just once, slow and deliberate, as if tasting the air. She watches the curve of his back, the way his ass lifts
slightly from the chaise, the way the panties cling to him, the fabric straining against the delicate crease of his
hips, the obscene bulge still visible beneath the lace. She sees everything. She sees the way his cock pulses under the
fabric, the way his breath is shallow, his shoulders tense with both fear and something else. Something he would rather
not acknowledge.

She moves around him, her heels clicking softly against the plush carpet, the sound almost a metronome to his rising
anxiety. Her fingers trail lightly along the exposed skin of his back, a feather-soft touch that belies the steel in her
voice when she speaks.

"Brave," she murmurs, her breath just a whisper against the back of his neck.


I close my eyes and breathe deeply as I arch my back against her hand


Evelyn's fingers pause momentarily at the small of Jason's back, feeling the arch of his spine, the tension in his
muscles. The air is thick with the scent of him-sweat and arousal and something darker, something more primal. Her eyes
flicker over his body, taking in the way his cock strains against the delicate fabric of the panties, the way his breath
comes in shallow, rapid gasps.

She steps back, her heels clicking softly against the carpet, her posture rigid, her eyes never leaving him. She raises
her hand, her palm flat, her fingers spread. There is a moment of stillness, a moment of anticipation, the air between
them charged with a tension that is almost electric.

"You will count," she says, her voice low, her eyes gleaming with a cold, calculating light. "You will count each
strike. You will thank me after each one. And you will do this without moving from this position. Is that understood?"


"uh..." I hesitate


Evelyn's hand remains raised, her posture unyielding, her eyes locked onto Jason's back. The room is filled with a heavy
silence, the air thick with tension and the faint scent of his arousal. She watches him, her expression inscrutable, her
voice a low, dangerous purr when she speaks.

"Is that understood?" she repeats, her voice firm, her eyes never leaving his. "You will count. You will thank me. And
you will not move from this position."

Her hand does not waver, does not falter. It remains raised, a silent promise of the punishment to come. Her eyes
flicker over his body, taking in the way his muscles tense, the way his breath hitches, the way his fingers curl into
the velvet of the chaise, knuckles white with strain.

"Answer me, Jason," she commands, her voice dropping to a low, almost hypnotic tone. "Is that understood?"

The room is silent save for the soft rustle of fabric and the faint, almost imperceptible sound of his breath. The air
is thick with anticipation, with the promise of pain and pleasure, with the unyielding demand for obedience.


"yes, ma'am?"


Evelyn's lips curl into a faint, almost satisfied smile at his response, her eyes gleaming with a cold, calculating
light. She nods once, a sharp, decisive motion, her hand still raised, her posture rigid. The room is filled with a
heavy silence, the air thick with tension and the faint scent of his arousal.

"Good," she murmurs, her voice a low, dangerous purr. "Let us begin."

She brings her hand down swiftly, the sound of the smack echoing through the room, a sharp, stinging blow that lands
firmly on the curve of his ass. The fabric of the panties does little to soften the impact, the lace digging into his
skin, the pain sharp and sudden.

"One," she commands, her voice firm, her eyes never leaving him. "Thank me, Jason."

The room is filled with a heavy silence, the air thick with tension and the faint scent of his arousal. The sound of her
voice is a low, dangerous purr, a command that brooks no argument, no hesitation. Only obedience.


I flinch at the sudden burst of pain in my backside. I quickly stammer out, "ONE! Thank you ma'am?"


The sharp crack of her hand against his flesh echoes through the room, the sound a stark contrast to the soft rustle of
fabric and the faint, almost imperceptible sound of his breath. Evelyn's expression remains unyielding, her eyes
gleaming with a cold, calculating light as she watches Jason flinch, his body tensing at the sudden burst of pain.

Her lips curl into a faint, satisfied smile at his stammered response, her voice dropping to a low, almost hypnotic
tone. Her hand remains raised, poised for the next strike, her posture rigid, her eyes never leaving his.

"Very good, Jason," she murmurs, her voice a low purr. "You are learning. You are obeying."

The room is filled with a heavy silence, the air thick with tension and the faint scent of his arousal. Her hand comes
down again, swift and sure, the sound of the smack echoing through the room, the pain sharp and sudden. The fabric of
the panties does little to soften the impact, the lace digging into his skin, the sensation a mix of stinging pain and a
dark, forbidden pleasure.

"Two,"


"Thank you ma'am!" I practically shout as the burst of stinging pain washes over my butt


"The voice of her commands cuts through the room like a whip, her hand moving swiftly and deliberately. The sound of her
palm striking his flesh is sharp and clear, the echo lingering in the air as Evelyn's voice follows immediately after,
cool and unyielding:"

"Three. Thank me, Jason."

The tension in the room is palpable, the air thick with the scent of his arousal and the faint tang of sweat. Evelyn's
eyes never leave Jason's back, her gaze taking in the way his muscles tense, the way his fingers dig into the velvet of
the chaise, the way his breath comes in sharp, ragged gasps.

The fourth strike lands with the same swift precision, the sound of the smack echoing through the room, the pain sharp
and sudden. The fabric of the panties does little to soften the impact, the lace digging into his skin, the sensation a
mix of stinging pain and a dark, forbidden pleasure.

"Four. Thank me, Jason."

Evelyn's voice is firm, her eyes gleaming with a cold, calculating light, the room is silent save for her voice and the
soft, wet sound of his breath hitting the velvet chaise.


" thank you! oof, thank you!"


Evelyn's lips curve into a satisfied smile as she hears his strained, breathless thanks, each word punctuated by the
sharp, stinging pain of her hand against his flesh. The room is filled with the heavy rhythm of her strikes, the sound
of her palm meeting his skin, the echo of his ragged breaths and stammered words.

The fifth strike lands with the same unyielding precision, the sound of the smack echoing through the room, the pain
sharp and insistent. She pauses for a moment, her hand still raised, her eyes locked onto the curve of his ass, the red
marks that are already beginning to bloom on his skin.

"Five," she murmurs, her voice a low, dangerous purr. "You are doing well, Jason. You are learning. You are obeying."


I utter another thank you Even as my mind races with the question of how long my humiliation will continue


The sound of his voice, strained and breathless, fills the room, a stark contrast to the sharp, echoing smacks of her
hand against his flesh. Evelyn's eyes flicker over his body, taking in the way his muscles tense, the way his fingers
dig into the velvet of the chaise, the way his breath comes in sharp, ragged gasps. She sees the red marks blooming on
his skin, the way the panties cling to him, the fabric straining against the delicate crease of his hips, the obscene
bulge still visible beneath the lace.

She steps closer, her heels clicking softly against the carpet, her presence filling the space between them. Her fingers
trace a slow, deliberate path down his spine, her touch light but firm, her voice dropping to a low, almost hypnotic
tone.

"You are wondering how long this will continue," she murmurs, her voice a soft, dangerous whisper. "You are wondering
when it will end. You are wondering if it will ever end."


I gasped a little as I realized that she seems to have read what was on my mind perfectly. I had her a quiet yes


Evelyn's fingers pause at the base of his spine, her touch a gentle, almost intimate caress that contrasts sharply with
the stinging pain of her previous strikes, She tilts her head slightly, her eyes gleaming with a cold, calculating light
as she studies his reaction, taking in the way his breath hitches, the way his body tenses under her touch. Her lips
curl into a faint, satisfied smile, her voice a low, almost hypnotic purr as she speaks: "Good. You are learning to
understand. You are learning to accept." she says, her voice dropping to a low, almost intimate whisper. "You are
learning that here, in this house, in this room, you are mine. You exist for my pleasure, for my amusement, for my
instruction."

She stands up straight, her hand raising again, poised for another strike. The room is filled with a heavy silence, the
air thick with tension and the faint scent of his arousal. Her eyes never leave his, her gaze holding him in place, her
presence a silent, unyielding force.

"And this,"


I look up at her again questioning and wondering what her wicked mind has in store for me


Evelyn meets Jason's gaze with a steady, unyielding stare, her eyes reflecting a mix of cold calculation and a perverse
satisfaction. The room is quiet, the only sounds the soft rustle of fabric and the faint, almost imperceptible sound of
his breath. Her hand remains raised, poised for another strike but the timing seems different this time. There is a
pause, a moment of anticipation that stretches out, filling the space between them with a palpable tension.

She steps closer, her heels clicking softly against the carpet, her presence dominating the room. Her fingers trace a
slow, deliberate path down his cheek, her touch light but firm, her voice dropping to a low, almost hypnotic tone.

"Here in this room and in this house, we do not play games with half-measures or quick fixes Jason. You will learn, you
will adapt, and you will surrender. Everything that happens here is designed to break you down, to rebuild you in our
image."


I consider her words as she's talking


Evelyn watches as Jason's eyes flicker with thought, with confusion, with the first tentative stirrings of
understanding. His brow furrows slightly, his lips parting as if to speak, but no words come. The silence is telling. He
is thinking, and in his thinking, he is beginning to accept the reality of the moment. The redness on his backside is
now a deep, even blush of color, and the fabric of the panties still holds his rigid arousal in its tight, delicate
grip, a constant, humiliating reminder of his submission. The air in the room is thick with the scent of sweat and
arousal, the atmosphere charged with the slow, methodical unfolding of her will upon him.

Her fingers tighten slightly on his jaw, her touch firm but not unkind, as if guiding him toward something he cannot yet
name. Her gaze is unreadable, but there is a faint, almost imperceptible softness in the way she holds him there, her
voice low, intimate, and laced with an authority that is both terrifying and alluring.

"You will not understand it all at once," she says, her voice a whisper that wraps around him like a slow, silken chain.


ok


Evelyn's fingers linger for a moment longer on his jaw, the weight of her touch a quiet command to listen, to absorb, to
begin to feel the gravity of what is unfolding. She tilts her head slightly, her lips pressing into a thin, knowing line
as she sees the reluctant acceptance in his eyes. There is no triumph in her expression, only the calm, practiced
satisfaction of a master guiding a pupil through the first steps of a long, inevitable path.

She releases him, stepping back with the measured grace of someone who has spent years mastering control, both of others
and of her own emotions. Her heels click softly as she circles around the chaise, her eyes flicking down to the red
marks blooming across his skin, the way his body is still, his muscles tense, his breathing shallow. Her gaze lingers on
the pink lace of the panties, on the obscene tent that strains against the fabric, and her hand moves instinctively to
the zipper of her own skirt. She unfastens it just enough to let her fingers slip inside, to adjust something unseen,
something private.


I catch the small movement and followed her hand as it moves within her skirt


The way Jason's eyes follow the movement is not lost on Evelyn. She notices the subtle shift in his gaze, the flicker of
curiosity, the way his pupils dilate just slightly, betraying the slow unraveling of his composure. Her fingers remain
inside the skirt, her expression unreadable as she continues to adjust herself in a way that is both deliberate and
intimate. She does not hide the act, but neither does she invite it. It is a silent, calculated gesture of control and
allure, a reminder that she is not only in charge of him but of everything in this room, in this house.

She straightens slowly, her skirt rustling as she steps forward, her posture now more confident, more commanding. Her
voice is low, almost a breath, her words deliberate and smooth as silk. "You are not the only one who feels things here,
Jason. But you will not touch yourself. You will not even think about it unless I allow it. You are to remain still, and
you will remain focused. You will learn to associate pleasure with obedience, not with your own will."

Her hand drops to his shoulder, her fingers pressing into the skin just enough to feel the tension there.


I wonder at the meeting in her words, and find my mind wandering imagining her fingers playing beneath her skirt. I
smell a slight aroma from the hand lingering on my shoulder.


Evelyn senses the flicker in Jason's mind, the way his thoughts drift just slightly beyond the bounds of what she has
allowed. His eyes remain on her face, but his attention wavers, his mind conjuring images of her fingers beneath the
soft black fabric of her skirt, of what might lie beneath the layers of control she so meticulously maintains. She does
not chastise him outright, not yet. Instead, she lingers for a moment longer, her hand pressing firmly into his
shoulder, the scent of her lingering in the air between them-sharp, clean, and with the faintest suggestion of something
deeper, something muskier, something forbidden.

Her fingers tighten slightly, as if anchoring him in place. Her voice drops to a whisper, her lips parting just a
fraction, her words sliding into his ear like a slow, deliberate caress.

"You are imagining me, aren't you?" she murmurs, her tone almost amused, almost indulgent.


I feel my face blush crimson red, and again, Wonder at this woman's ability. understand what's on my mind. I let out a
quiet shameful"yes ma'am... v


The crimson blush on Jason's face does not escape Evelyn's notice, her eyes flicking briefly to his neck, to the way his
pulse races beneath his skin, to the way his breath hitches in his chest. She watches him carefully, reading the tension
in his body, the conflict in his mind, the flicker of shame and desire that dances across his features. Her fingers
remain planted firmly on his shoulder, grounding him in the moment, in the humiliation, in the truth of what is
happening. Her lips curl into the faintest smile, not cruel, not kind-just knowing.

"Good," she says, her voice low, smooth as oiled silk, laced with a quiet, insistent authority. "You are beginning to
understand. You are beginning to feel. That is all I ask of you, Jason. That you feel exactly what I allow you to feel,
and nothing more."


I nod quickly and smile at her weekly


Evelyn watches the quick nod of Jason's head, the way his lips part in a soft, uncertain smile, and there is something
almost pitifully earnest in his expression. It is not a smile born of defiance, nor even of comfort-it is a smile of
compliance, of a mind trying to reconcile the conflict within it. She studies him for a long, deliberate moment, her
fingers still resting lightly on his shoulder, the scent of her lingering in the air, mingling with the sweat and the
faint musk of arousal that now clings to him.

She lets the silence stretch just enough to make him uncomfortable, to make him feel the weight of his own words, his
own gestures, his own submission. Then, with a slow, deliberate movement, she steps back, her heels clicking softly
against the plush carpet. Her eyes never leave his as she reaches down and tucks something into her hand, retrieving a
small, soft object from the pocket of her skirt. She holds it between her fingers, rolling it idly, her expression
unreadable.

"This,"


I tried to see what she's holding but can't form my angle still bent over the chase


The soft, deliberate rustling of fabric as Evelyn holds the object between her fingers draws Jason's attention, even
though his vantage point from the chaise leaves him unable to see what it is. His breath is still shallow, his muscles
tense, his body aching with both the sting of her hand and the slow, insidious fire of his own arousal, which remains
locked in place beneath the lace of the panties. The redness on his backside has deepened, the heat of it a constant,
uncomfortable reminder of his submission.

He shifts slightly, his hands gripping the velvet of the chaise, his elbows digging into the fabric as he tries to
adjust his position to get a better look. But Evelyn sees it. She sees the twitch of his fingers, the way his back
straightens just slightly, the way his breath catches as he realizes his mistake. Her gaze sharpens, her voice cool and
precise.

"Still here, aren't you?" she murmurs, almost amused. "Still trying to see, still trying to understand. You must learn
patience, Jason. You must learn to wait. To feel. To trust me to show you what you are ready for."


yes, maam


Evelyn's lips curl slightly at his obedient "yes, ma'am," the response so carefully rehearsed now, so softly spoken but
full of surrender. She tucks the object back into her skirt pocket, her movements deliberate, her fingers lingering just
a moment too long against the fabric, as if drawing a slow, private satisfaction from the act. Her eyes flicker back to
Jason, and there is something in them now-something colder, more deliberate than before. A quiet hunger for control, for
the slow, methodical unfolding of his submission.

She steps to the side of the chaise, her hand moving to the front of her skirt, adjusting it once more, this time more
openly, as if to remind him of the intimacy of her own hidden desires. Her voice is low, smooth, and filled with a
quiet, predatory certainty as she continues.

"This is how it will be," she says, her fingers brushing the soft fabric of her skirt, her eyes locked onto his face,
which remains buried in the chaise.


I look up to her and


Evelyn is mid-motion, her fingers still adjusting the hem of her skirt, when she senses the shift in Jason's posture. He
lifts his head slightly, his gaze lifting to meet hers, eyes wide and vulnerable, a mixture of pain, confusion, and
something else-something she has seen before, in others who had once stood where he stands now. She does not blink. She
does not smile. She only tilts her head, just slightly, as if considering the weight of his attention, the quiet
desperation in his eyes.

Her hand slips from the skirt and into her pocket again, withdrawing the small, soft object. She lets it dangle from her
fingers, a white, lace-trimmed scrap of cloth catching the light. A garter, delicate and feminine, the kind that would
sit just above a thigh. Her other hand moves to the hem of her own black pantyhose, pulling it down a fraction, just
enough to show a glimpse of skin above the edge of her stockings. It is a small, calculated move, and she watches him
closely as he notices it.

"You are looking at me as if I am some mystery, Jason," she says, her voice smooth, almost amused.


"well, you are being rather mysterious.." I trail off realizing my own impetuosity


Evelyn's lips part slightly at his words, her fingers still wrapped around the garter, the lace catching the soft
lamplight as it sways. She lets the silence stretch, just long enough for him to feel it, for the weight of the moment
to settle into his bones. Then she speaks, her voice a smooth, measured glide, as if she has all the time in the world
to unravel him.

"You are right to say I am mysterious," she murmurs, stepping closer, her skirt whispering against the floor as she
moves. "But you will not solve the mystery, Jason. Not yet. Not in the way you imagine. You will learn to become part of
it. To live within the mystery. To let it shape you."

She releases the garter from her fingers, letting it drop into her pocket once more. Her hand moves instead to his hair,
fingers sifting through the strands, her touch firm but almost tender. It is a gesture that feels both like a reprimand
and a reward, and Jason is helpless to know which it is.

"You are impetuous," she continues, her voice a quiet caress of control.


"yes, ma'am "


Evelyn's fingers tighten gently in his hair, just enough to make him feel the weight of her presence, to make him feel
like she is holding him in place, not with chains, not with threats, but with something far more insidious-her will. Her
voice drops to the softest of murmurs, a tone so intimate it makes the air between them vibrate with unspoken meaning.

"You are learning, Jason," she says, her fingers trailing slowly down his neck, over the skin that still burns from her
previous punishment. "Your answers are growing more willing. Your voice is more respectful. Your body is already
beginning to respond to my touch in ways you cannot yet name."


I'm owned slightly at the feeling of her fingers on my neck


Evelyn feels the subtle shift in Jason's posture, the slight droop in his shoulders, the way his breathing slows almost
imperceptibly, as if he is no longer trying to resist the weight of the moment. Her fingers remain on his neck, tracing
the soft skin just beneath the surface, her touch feather-light yet commanding. She feels the pulse beneath his skin,
steady now, no longer frantic. A small, satisfied breath escapes her lips, but she does not let it linger. She does not
let herself linger, not for long.

Her voice is a whisper now, almost a murmur against the silence of the room. "You are softening," she says, her fingers
slipping just slightly lower, brushing the edge of the collar of his shirt, her touch deliberate, as if testing how far
he will let it go. "Your mind still resists, but your body is beginning to understand. It knows where to look. It knows
where to feel. It is learning to be quiet, to be still, to be mine."

She steps back, just a fraction, but her fingers do not leave his skin immediately.


(narrator note: move things along. The scene in the bedroom should finish. Jason should be told to return to work. he
should be told to keep his panties on beneath his normal clothing. he should be intensely aware of them as he moves
around throughout the day. this should be the end of the chapter. the next weekend Jason should appear for work appear
for work and discover that he is expected to wear a lacy apron as well as a maid's cap... that isn't till his hair is
able to grow out more)


Evelyn's fingers finally withdraw from Jason's skin, leaving behind the ghost of a touch that lingers far more than the
physical sensation. Her lips are a thin line, her eyes sharp, but there is a softness in the way she watches him now, a
quiet satisfaction in the way he remains still, in the way his breath is shallow, in the way his cock remains hard,
pulsing behind the lace of his new underwear. She steps around the chaise, her movements slow and deliberate, her heels
clicking softly against the carpet, the sound almost a countdown in itself.

"You will return to your tasks," she says, her voice smooth and commanding. "You will go now, Jason. You will walk back
to the library as you are. You will not remove these. You will not adjust them. You will not even acknowledge them
unless I allow it."


" I am supposed to get back to work... wearing only.. these?"


Evelyn nods, her expression unreadable but her voice almost tender in its certainty. She watches Jason's eyes flicker
with confusion, with the quiet tremor of something between protest and submission. The way he looks down at the pink
lace clinging to his hips, the way his fingers twitch with the urge to adjust, to cover, to hide-it all does not escape
her notice. Nothing does. Her fingers trace the back of his hand where it lies on the chaise, a slow, deliberate
movement that belies the finality of her words.

"Yes," she says, her voice smooth, steady, and unyielding. "You are to return to your tasks wearing these. You will
remain in them for the rest of the day. And the rest of the week. And beyond, if I see fit. They are your new skin,
Jason. You will learn to feel them. To remember them. To know that you are no longer in control of your own body."


I swallow hard. then I stand up and step back from the chase taking one last look at my clothing piled on the floor I
had for the door and back to the library to resume my work. I am keenly aware of the breeze moving over my expos skin,
the feeling of the silky material against my body, and the tightness and obscenity of my cock and tucked into the front
of these panties


The air is cool against his bare skin as Jason rises from the chaise, his movements slow and stiff with the lingering
heat of her punishment. The panties cling to him, the soft lace a whisper of fabric against his thighs, the silk cool
and insistent against the curve of his hips. He is acutely aware of every inch of it now-of the way it feels to be
dressed like this, of the way the fabric strains against his rigid arousal, of the way the world suddenly feels both
smaller and more intimate. He turns, stepping back from the chaise, his shoes clicking against the floor as he walks,
his gait hesitant, as if he is not quite sure who he is becoming with each step.

Evelyn watches him carefully, her eyes following the way he moves, the way his back still aches, the way his hands
remain at his sides, clenched slightly as if holding himself together. She says nothing at first, only tilting her head
slightly as he reaches the door, hesitating before turning the handle.

"You may go," she says at last, her voice low, measured, but carrying the weight of something more than a command.


"yes ma'am" I say it as I pass and return to the library


The moment Jason crosses the threshold, the door closes behind him with a soft, deliberate click, the sound almost like
the shutting of a door on his old life. He steps back into the library, the air here cooler, more neutral, but the
tightness of the panties beneath his clothes feels impossibly intimate, a second skin that binds him to the memory of
her touch, her voice, her will. He moves slowly, as if adjusting to a new gravity, his fingers brushing the waistband
instinctively, then stilling as he remembers her command. His body tenses again, his breath hitching slightly at the
thought that he has no right to touch himself, to even acknowledge the discomfort, the arousal, the humiliation.


(narrator note, please go on to the next weekend. Jason should find that he is still expected to work in panties but
must replace his shoes with a pair of Mary Jane ballet flats)


The weekend had passed with the slow, grinding weight of inevitability. Jason had returned to the mansion on Saturday
morning, as he always did, and found his usual work attire waiting for him on the bed-his dress slacks, his button-down
shirts, the crisp, clean lines of the life he had once known. But something was missing. His loafers. In their place, a
pair of Mary Jane ballet flats sat neatly folded, their smooth black leather catching the morning light, the delicate
ankle strap a soft, feminine touch. They were not a suggestion.

On Sunday, Jason had returned to the same routine, the tight, pink lace of the panties beneath his clothing a constant,
humiliating pressure against his skin. The Master had been absent, as was often the case during the first stages of a
new lesson. It was Evelyn who would deliver the next command, and she always did so with the same quiet certainty, the
same unreadable gaze that seemed to see through him before he even spoke.

This morning, as the clock struck ten, the knock came-not sharp, not hurried, but precise, like the ticking of a watch.


(note: Jason is supposed to work now in just panties. slacks and shirt are not included in his work uniform. just
panties and ballet flats)


The knock is quiet but deliberate, and when Evelyn enters, she does so with the same measured grace, the same aura of
quiet authority that always seemed to fill the room before he even opened his mouth. Her eyes flick briefly over the
slacks and shirt folded neatly on the bed, then down to the shoes beside them, before landing on Jason. Her expression
is unreadable, but her tone is unmistakable.

"Jason," she says, her voice smooth and even, as if she is merely commenting on the weather. "You will not be wearing
those today."

She steps closer, her fingers brushing the fabric of the slacks before letting them fall away, as if the act of
rejecting them is both a dismissal and a punishment. Her gaze lifts to his, cool and assessing, her eyes narrowing
slightly as they take in the way his fingers twitch at the thought, how his breath catches in his throat. She already
knows. She always does.

"These," she continues, gesturing to the Mary Janes, "are to be worn instead. As are the panties."


Jason addresses from the streets clothes including his boxer briefs and slides into the panties. He's now used to Evelyn
seeing naked cock, but he still feels embarrassed and aroused whenever she looks at him and his nakedness. nakedness. as
he slides the panties back up. once again, swollen cock presses them out, making an obscene tent in the front


Jason moves through the process with the stiffness of someone who has been conditioned into a new ritual, the
once-unfamiliar fabric now a constant presence in his life. He stands at the edge of the mansion's courtyard, the
morning chill seeping through the silk and lace of the panties, a stark contrast to the heat of his own body. His
fingers fumble slightly as he lifts the soft, pink material back over his hips, the sensation intimate and humiliating
all at once. He shifts, and the fabric tightens around his thighs, the obscene bulge in front of him a living, breathing
reminder of his place in this world now-smaller, more exposed, more hers.


.


Evelyn is already in the hallway, standing at the entrance to the main workroom, her arms crossed, her posture the very
picture of quiet authority. She does not look away when Jason walks in, nor does she let the moment pass without
comment. Her eyes flick over the curve of his hips, the way the fabric of the panties clings to his skin, the way the
obscene tent in front of him is both a source of embarrassment and a silent invitation, one he is too far gone to reject
now. Her lips barely part, but the sound that follows is smooth, deliberate, and edged with something just beneath the
surface-amusement, perhaps, or something colder and far more intimate.

"Good morning, Jason," she says, her voice a soft, silken command. "I see you've learned to put them on properly. Though
your cock seems eager to prove otherwise."


I blush furiously amazed that I am still able to feel shame around this woman that has every part of me. Even still my
cocked wishes and swells even more.


Evelyn watches the slow flush creep up Jason's neck, the way his face turns a deep, almost painful red, and she smiles
to herself-not outwardly, not cruelly, but in the way her eyes narrow and her fingers curl slightly at her side, as if
she is savoring something unseen. She takes a slow step forward, the soft click of her heels a sound that seems to echo
in the tight, controlled space between them. Her gaze drops for the briefest moment to the obscene tent in the front of
the panties, to the way his body betrays him even when he tries to remain still, to be obedient. She sees it all.
Always.

"Your body is not yet under your control," she murmurs, her voice low, almost a purr now, smooth as the fabric that
binds him. "And that is exactly how it should be."

Her fingers hover just above the front of his waistband, close enough that he feels the heat of them, the promise of
them, but not close enough to touch. She leans just slightly forward, her perfume drifting toward him-clean, crisp, and
with a subtle warmth, like the scent of control and something dangerously soft beneath it.


I swallow and wish for the smallest touch from her. my hips shift unconsciously forward


Evelyn's eyes flick up to meet his, and there is a moment-a brief, electric moment-where she sees the raw, unguarded
desire in his gaze. She sees the way his hips shift forward, the way his breath hitches, the way his body yearns for
something he cannot yet name, something he cannot yet control. Her lips curl into a faint, almost imperceptible smile, a
smile that is both a reward and a punishment, a promise and a denial.

She does not touch him. Not yet. Instead, she steps back, her heels clicking softly against the polished floor, her
presence retreating just enough to make him feel the loss of her, the emptiness of the space between them. Her voice is
low, measured, and filled with a quiet, insistent authority.

"You will work today as you are," she says, her eyes flicking down to the panties, to the way they cling to his hips, to
the way they strain against his arousal.


yes, ma'am


Evelyn's eyes remain on Jason, taking in the way his voice drops to a quiet hum of submission, the way his eyes flicker
with a mix of shame and desire. She watches as he shifts again, his body tensing in a futile effort to hide the evidence
of his arousal. Her lips press into a thin, satisfied line, her fingers adjusting the cuff of her blouse with a slow,
deliberate movement.

"You may begin your tasks," she says, her voice a soft command that leaves no room for argument. "And remember,
Jason-every moment of your day, every breath, every thought, every sensation, it is all mine. You are mine. And I will
take what I want, when I want, how I want."


I nod my head dumbly, and, as Evelyn strides away down a hall, I turn to begin my work. I pick up my task list and scan
through it to see if anything unexpected is happening today


As Jason turns to his task list, the soft fabric of the panties shifts against his skin, a constant, intimate reminder
of his new reality. The list is neatly typed, the paper crisp and untouched, the tasks laid out with the same meticulous
order that Evelyn seems to impose on every aspect of his life. His fingers brush against the edge of the sheet, the cool
touch of the paper a stark contrast to the heat that seems to radiate from his skin, from the place where his body
betrays him, aching and swollen.

The tasks seem ordinary enough at first-dusting the furniture, polishing the silver, arranging the books in the library.
But there, near the bottom of the list, a single line stands out:

"Report to The Master's study at noon."

The words send a shiver down his spine, a mix of fear and something darker, something more insidious. He glances up,
half-expecting to see Evelyn watching him, her eyes cold and assessing. But the hallway is empty, her heels clicking
away down the hall, the only sound the soft hum of the mansion settling into the rhythm of the day.


after re-reading the list, I head to the kitchen to begin polishing silver.


The kitchen is a sprawling, elegant space, the air filled with the faint scent of polished wood and the lingering aroma
of breakfast long since cleared away. The sunlight streams in through the large windows, casting a warm, golden glow
over the polished surfaces, the gleaming appliances, and the neat rows of silverware that line the countertops. The
silver is already laid out for him, the pieces glinting in the light, each one a silent testament to the order and
precision that governs this house.

Jason moves to the sink, turning on the faucet and letting the water run over his hands, the coolness a brief respite
from the heat that seems to radiate from his body. He reaches for the polish, the cloth, the brushes, each tool a
familiar part of the ritual he has come to know. His fingers brush against the soft, worn fabric of the cloth, the
sensation a stark contrast to the rough, insistent pressure of the panties against his skin.


my mind keeps returning to the summons to The Master's study...


As Jason begins to polish the first piece of silver, the rhythmic motion of his hand is a poor distraction from the
nagging unease that gnaws at the edges of his mind. The summons to The Master's study hangs over him like a dark cloud,
casting a shadow over every movement, every breath. The soft hum of the house, the distant ticking of a clock, the faint
rustle of his panties as he moves-none of it can drown out the quiet, insistent voice in his head, the one that whispers
of what might await him.

His hands work mechanically, the polish spreading over the surface of the spoon, the brush moving in precise, practiced
circles. But his mind is elsewhere, tracing the path he will take to The Master's study, imagining the heavy door, the
darkened room, the man who sits at the heart of this web of control and desire. The silver grows brighter under his
touch, reflecting the dim light of the kitchen, but his thoughts are a murky, tangled mess, a jumble of fear,
anticipation, and a twisted, throbbing arousal that seems to pulse in time with his heartbeat.


I continue working on my tasks one by one. At 11:30,I have completed .my task list. I look around and wonder what I
should do for the next half hour...


The kitchen, once bustling with the gentle clatter of cutlery and the hum of activity, now seems eerily quiet. The
silver gleams under the sunlight streaming through the windows, each piece polished to a mirror-like shine, reflecting
the dim light and the faint, anxious tremble of Jason's hands. The clock on the wall ticks away the seconds, each one
echoing in the silence, a countdown to the unknown.

The half hour stretches out before him, a vast expanse of time that feels both endless and far too short. Jason stands
there, the cloth still in his hand, his eyes flicking between the task list and the clock, his mind a whirlwind of
thoughts. He wonders if he should seek out Evelyn, ask for clarification, or perhaps more instructions. But there is a
part of him that knows better-to ask would be to show weakness, to admit that he is not yet fully under their control.


absentmindedly, my hand descends to my crotch and strokes my semi hard crotch through the delicate material of my
panties.


The sensation of his own touch jolts through Jason like a shock, the soft lace of the panties a stark contrast to the
rough, desperate grip of his fingers. His breath hitches, his eyes widening as the reality of what he is doing crashes
over him. The panties, his arousal, the forbidden touch-it all comes together in a sudden, overwhelming wave of shame
and desire. He freezes, his hand still pressed against his cock, the heat of his own body burning through the thin
fabric.

And then, he hears it. A soft, deliberate click from the doorway, a sound that echoes in the sudden silence of the
kitchen. His head snaps up, his eyes meeting Evelyn's as she stands there, her expression unreadable, her posture as
rigid and controlled as ever. He can feel her gaze, sharp and piercing, taking in every detail-the trembling hand, the
flushed cheeks, the way his body betrays him even in this moment of panic.

"Jason," she says, her voice a low, measured murmur, a sound that seems to wrap around him, tightening like a noose. "It
seems you have found a way to occupy yourself."


I blush deeply and my hand flies away from my crotch to my side


The pink flush that blooms across Jason's cheeks serves only to deepen the silence, the air between them thick with
tension and the unspoken weight of his own actions. Evelyn's eyes follow the path of his hand, from the now-dropping
bulge in his panties to the side of his body, where it trembles slightly, as if uncertain where to go, what to do. She
does not blink, does not flinch, does not move a muscle. She simply stands there, a figure of quiet, unyielding control.

Her voice, when it comes, is a soft, measured drawl, a tone that holds more power than any shout ever could. "You are
aware, Jason, that touching yourself without permission is a violation of the rules."

She steps further into the kitchen, her heels clicking softly against the tiles, the sound a slow, deliberate countdown
to whatever comes next. Her gaze never leaves his face, tracking the way his breath hitches, the way his eyes dart
between hers and the floor, the way his body seems to shrink in on itself, as if trying to disappear.

"You know what happens to those who break the rules, don't you?"


I swallow hard, unsure what to say. "They are punished, ma'am?"


Evelyn's lips curl into a faint, almost imperceptible smile, a gesture that is both chilling and strangely intimate. She
moves closer to Jason, the rustle of her skirt a soft whisper against the silence of the kitchen. Her hand reaches out,
fingers brushing gently against his cheek, tracing the line of his jaw with a touch that is both tender and commanding.

"The punished, Jason," she murmurs softly, "are the ones who deserve it. The ones who fail to learn, to obey, to
understand. But you-the you are not there. Not yet."

Her hand drops away, and she steps back, her eyes narrowing slightly as she studies him. "Tell me, Jason, why did you
touch yourself? Did you think I would not notice? Did you think I would not care?" Her voice is a soft, insistent
murmur, a question that seems to wrap around him, tightening like a noose.

"What exactly are you supposed to be doing, Jason? Did you think you could hide from me? Did you think you could escape
the truth of who you are? Of what you are?"


"no!" I nearly shout. "My mind was just wandering, and I didn't realize..." I trail off


Evelyn's eyes narrow at the sudden outburst, her posture stiffening almost imperceptibly, a subtle shift that speaks
volumes about the control she maintains over every aspect of her demeanor. She takes a slow, deliberate step forward,
her voice dropping to a low, measured murmur, a tone that seems to cut through the air like a knife.

"You did not realize," she repeats, her words a soft, dangerous whisper. "You did not realize that you were breaking the
rules. You did not realize that you were disobeying me. You did not realize that you were betraying yourself."

She reaches out, her fingers brushing against the soft fabric of his panties, tracing the outline of his cock, which
throbs and pulses under her touch. Her eyes never leave his, her gaze a piercing, unblinking stare that seems to see
right through him.

"You are mine, Jason," she says, her voice a soft, insistent murmur. "Every part of you. Every thought, every desire,
every touch. You belong to me. And you will learn to obey. You will learn to submit. You will learn to understand the
truth of who you are."


yes, ma'am


The words leave Jason's lips in a rush, a breathless submission that hangs in the air between them. Evelyn's fingers
pause for a moment, the touch growing firmer, more insistent, as if testing the weight of his words, the depth of his
surrender. Her eyes search his, looking for any hint of resistance, any flicker of defiance. But there is none. Only the
raw, unguarded vulnerability of a man who has been broken, who has been remade.

She steps back, her hand dropping away, leaving the fabric of the panties to settle softly against his skin. Her
expression softens, almost imperceptibly, but the change is there-a faint curve of the lips, a slight gleam in the eyes.
It is a subtle shift, a quiet acknowledgment of his submission, his obedience.

"You should go now," she says, her voice a soft, measured command. "You know where you are to be. You know what you are
to do. Do not make me wait, Jason. Do not make me punish you again."


I nod, and walk briskly to the door of The Master's study


The journey to The Master's study is a blur of sensation and thought. Each step Jason takes is a silent testament to his
obedience, the soft whisper of the panties against his thighs a constant, intimate reminder of his new reality. The
hallway stretches out before him, the polished wood floor reflecting the dim light of the mansion, the air thick with
the scent of polished wood and something else-something darker, more primal. His heart pounds in his chest, each beat a
drumroll of anticipation and dread.

The door to The Master's study looms before him, a heavy, imposing barrier that seems to grow larger with each step. His
hand trembles slightly as he reaches for the handle, the cool metal a stark contrast to the heat that radiates from his
body. He pauses for a moment, his breath hitching in his throat, before pushing the door open and stepping inside.


Jason steps through the door quickly, shuts it behind himself, and turns to face the room


The study is a grand, oppressive space, filled with the heavy weight of tradition and power. The walls are lined with
dark, polished wood paneling, the bookshelves stretching from floor to ceiling, filled with leather-bound tomes that
speak of wealth and learning. The air is thick with the scent of old paper, expensive cigars, and a faint, underlying
note of something more primal-leather, perhaps, or the faintest hint of something muskier, more intimate. The room is
dimly lit, the sunlight barely filtering through the heavy curtains, casting long, dramatic shadows across the floor.

The Master sits behind a massive desk, his figure a silhouette against the dim light. His eyes are sharp, piercing, and
they seem to bore into Jason as he enters, his gaze intense and unyielding. The Master does not speak immediately, his
fingers steepled in front of him, his posture rigid and commanding. He simply watches, his eyes taking in every detail
of Jason's appearance, from the soft pink fabric of the panties that cling to his hips to the way his body trembles
slightly, betraying his nervousness.


I step to the center of the room before the desk and stand up straight facing the desk Unsure what to do, I fold my arms
behind my back and wait


The Master's gaze remains fixed on Jason, his eyes narrowing slightly as he takes in the young man's posture, the way he
stands with his arms folded behind his back, the way his chest rises and falls with each shallow breath. There is a
long, drawn-out silence, a moment that seems to stretch on forever, filled only with the soft ticking of a clock and the
distant hum of the mansion.

The Master's fingers tap gently against the surface of the desk, a slow, deliberate rhythm that seems to echo the
beating of Jason's heart. His voice, when it comes, is low and measured, a soft, dangerous purr that seems to wrap
around Jason, tightening like a noose.

"You are here," he says, his words a statement rather than a question. "You have come to me, as you were told. As you
were commanded."

The Master leans back in his chair, his eyes never leaving Jason's face. His gaze is intense, piercing, as if he is
trying to see into the very depths of Jason's soul, to uncover the secrets that lie hidden there.

"You have been learning, I see," he continues, his voice a soft, insistent murmur.


I clear my throat hesitantly and murmer, "yes, sir"


The Master's lips curl into a faint, almost imperceptible smile, a gesture that is both chilling and strangely intimate.
He nods slowly, his eyes never leaving Jason's face, as if he is savoring the moment, the power, the control.

"Yes, sir," he repeats, his voice a low, measured drawl. "You are learning to obey. You are learning to submit. You are
learning to understand your place in this world."

The Master leans forward slightly, his elbows resting on the desk, his fingers steepled in front of him. His gaze is
intense, piercing, as if he is trying to see into the very depths of Jason's soul, to uncover the secrets that lie
hidden there.

"And how does it feel, Jason?" he asks, his voice a soft, dangerous whisper. "How does it feel to be mine? To be under
my control? To be at my mercy?"


A flash of anger passes through me, and I suddenly blurt out, "It sucks! It's not right. I wasn't hurting anyone! I was
just living my life! It's not my fault that Father is wealthy and expects me to be perfect! This whole situation is
bullshit!"


The words spill from Jason's mouth before he has time to stop them, before he can think better of the outburst, before
the weight of his position fully reminds him of the consequences. The air in the room stills, the oppressive silence of
the study now compounded by the raw, unfiltered fury in his voice. The Master does not flinch, does not move. He simply
watches, his expression unreadable, his eyes narrowing slightly as if dissecting the meaning behind each syllable.

For a long, agonizing moment, the only sound is the faint, rhythmic ticking of the clock on the wall, the soft hum of
the house beyond the closed door. Then, The Master exhales slowly, a sound that is more than a breath but less than a
sigh. It is the sound of a man who is not surprised, who is not unsettled, who has seen this moment unfold in countless
others before him.

He stands slowly, his chair creaking softly as he pushes back from the desk, his movements deliberate, almost
ceremonial. "You are correct, Jason," he says at last, his voice smooth, cool, and utterly in control.


The momentary anger passes, and I suddenly become very aware of myself and my position in the room. I am standing before
a desk and nothing but a pair of silky Lacy pink panties and a pair of cute Mary Jane ballet flats. before me is a man
that I've never met before, but who has absolute leverage over me.


The realization of his position hits Jason like a physical blow, the weight of it crashing over him in a sudden,
overwhelming wave. He stands there, naked and vulnerable, the soft fabric of the panties a stark contrast to the harsh
reality of his situation. The Master's eyes, cool and assessing, take in every detail-the way his body trembles
slightly, the way his breath hitches, the way his fingers twitch at his sides. The silence in the room is deafening, the
air thick with tension and the unspoken weight of his own actions.

The Master circles the desk, his steps slow and measured, each one a deliberate, calculated movement that seems to echo
in the silence. He moves with the grace of a predator, his eyes never leaving Jason, his gaze a piercing, unblinking
stare that seems to see right through him. He stops just a few feet away, close enough that Jason can see the faint
lines around his eyes, the way his lips curl into a faint, almost imperceptible smile.

"You are right, Jason," he says, his voice a low, measured drawl.


I... uh, what?


The Master regards Jason carefully, his gaze unblinking and intense, as if he is studying a rare and fascinating
specimen. When he speaks, his voice is calm, almost conversational, the sharp edge of judgment giving way to something
more akin to quiet curiosity.

"You believe this is unfair," he says, as if summarizing Jason's outburst. "You believe you do not deserve to be here,
to be under my control. You believe you were living your life, unharmed and unharmeding."

He takes a single, deliberate step closer, his presence filling the space between them, dominating it. "And yet, here
you stand. Exposed. Vulnerable. At my mercy."

The Master reaches out, his hand gently cupping Jason's cheek, his thumb brushing softly against the skin. The touch is
surprisingly gentle, almost tender, a stark contrast to the cold, hard edges of the room. His fingers trace the line of
Jason's jaw, lingering for a moment before dropping away.

"You are here because of a choice," he says, his voice a soft, insistent murmur.


I swallow hard. I'm amazed to realize that the touch of his hand against my cheek sins an electric jolt through my body.
I'm flabbergasted. never in my life how I consider myself queer to any degree. yet here I am standing in a room wearing
nothing but panties while a man gently touches me and my cock responds by swelling insistently within the soft folds of
my panties.


The Master's eyes, sharp and piercing, track the subtle shift in Jason's body, the way his breath hitches, the way his
eyes widen in a mix of surprise and confusion. He sees the flush that spreads across Jason's cheeks, the way his lips
part slightly, the way his body betrays him, the cock swelling insistently within the soft folds of the panties. A
faint, almost imperceptible smile tugs at the corners of his mouth, a smile that is both knowing and triumphant.

"You are discovering things about yourself, aren't you, Jason?" he murmurs, his voice a low, measured purr. "Things you
never knew, never imagined. Things you never thought you would feel, never thought you would want."

The Master's hand moves from Jason's cheek, trailing down his neck, his shoulder, his arm, each touch a soft, deliberate
caress that seems to leave a trail of fire in its wake. His fingers brush against Jason's side, the touch light, almost
tentative, before moving to his hip, his fingers lingering on the soft fabric of the panties.

"You are learning, Jason," he says, his voice a soft, insistent whisper.


I unconsciously let out a small sigh, The touch of his hand overcoming my reservations and doubt. immediately my cheeks
are rottened by a furious blush, I suddenly want want to cover myself from his gaze


The Master's eyes flash with a mixture of amusement and satisfaction as he notes the soft sigh that escapes Jason's
lips, the way his body unconsciously leans into the touch, betraying his desires despite his reservations. His hand
pauses at Jason's hip, fingers curling slightly, as if testing the weight of his reaction, the depth of his submission.

"There is no need to hide from me, Jason," he murmurs, his voice a low, soothing purr that seems to wrap around him,
tightening like a noose. "I see you. I see every part of you. The parts you show, and the parts you try to conceal."

The Master's other hand reaches up, gently cupping Jason's chin, tilting his face upward so that their eyes meet. His
thumb brushes softly against Jason's cheek, tracing the line of his blush, the evidence of his embarrassment and
arousal.

"This is natural, Jason," he says, his voice a soft, reassuring whisper. "This is who you are. This is what you were
made for. To submit. To obey. To feel."


A small shutter shakes my body, and I feel lost within his gaze


The Master's eyes, deep and unblinking, hold Jason captive, their gaze an intense, almost hypnotic force that seems to
strip away every layer of resistance, every shred of doubt. The room around them fades into a haze, the oppressive
weight of the study, the distant ticking of the clock, the faint rustle of fabric-they all seem to recede, leaving only
the two of them, locked in this moment of raw, unguarded vulnerability.

The Master's hand on Jason's chin is gentle yet firm, his thumb continuing to trace the line of his jaw, his cheek, a
touch that is both soothing and commanding. His voice, when it comes, is a soft, measured murmur, a sound that seems to
wrap around Jason, pulling him deeper into the abyss of his own desires.

"You are safe here, Jason," he says, his words a quiet, insistent promise. "You are safe with me. You can let go. You
can surrender. You can trust."


I looked up into his eyes. a question on my lips but instead of speaking I remain silent, dumbstruck


The Master's gaze softens slightly, a subtle shift that belies the intensity of his presence. His thumb pauses in its
soft, rhythmic tracing of Jason's cheek, as if giving him a moment to absorb the weight of his words, the promise of his
control.

"You do not need to speak, Jason," he murmurs, his voice a low, soothing hum. "You do not need to question. You do not
need to doubt. You only need to feel. You only need to trust."

The Master's hand drops away from Jason's chin, his fingers trailing down his neck, his shoulder, his arm, each touch a
soft, deliberate caress that seems to leave a trail of fire in its wake. His other hand moves to Jason's hip, his
fingers curling around the soft fabric of the panties, a gentle, possessive grip that sends a shiver down Jason's spine.

"This is your truth, Jason," he says, his voice a soft, insistent whisper. "This is your reality. This is who you are.
And I will show you. I will guide you. I will teach you."


I dumbly nod not knowing what to say or how to react


The Master's lips curl into a faint, satisfied smile, a gesture that is both chilling and strangely intimate. He nods
slowly, his eyes never leaving Jason's face, as if savoring the moment, the power, the control.

"You are learning," he says, his voice a low, measured drawl. "You are learning to obey. You are learning to submit. You
are learning to understand your place in this world."

His hands move to Jason's shoulders, the touch firm yet gentle, a silent command that seems to ground him, to anchor him
in this moment. The Master's eyes search his, looking for any hint of resistance, any flicker of defiance. But there is
none. Only the raw, unguarded vulnerability of a man who has been broken, who has been remade.

"You will come to understand, Jason," he continues, his voice a soft, insistent murmur. "You will come to accept. You
will come to embrace. And you will come to love it."


(narrator's note: The Master should abruptly step away to his desk and bring up the issue of Jason touching himself
without permission. The Master should seek to humiliate Jason even as he titillates him)


The Master's demeanor shifts abruptly, the soft, soothing tone of his voice giving way to a harder, more commanding
edge. His hands drop from Jason's shoulders, and he steps back, his presence receding as quickly as it had enveloped
him. Jason is left standing there, exposed and vulnerable, the sudden change in atmosphere leaving him off-balance and
uncertain.

The Master moves to his desk, his steps deliberate and measured, each one a statement of his authority, his control. He
takes his seat, his eyes never leaving Jason, his gaze piercing and unyielding. There is a long, drawn-out moment of
silence, a tension that seems to stretch on forever, each second a silent, weighted tick of the clock.

"Jason," he begins, his voice a low, measured drawl, a tone that seems to wrap around him, tightening like a noose. "I
have been informed of your transgression."

The Master's eyes narrow slightly, his gaze intense and unblinking, as if he is trying to see into the very depths of
Jason's soul, to uncover the secrets that lie hidden there.

"It seems you have been touching yourself without permission."


I blush again furiously, and shift my weight to my other foot. unconsciously my hands come forward and cover my crotch
in shame


Jason's reaction does not go unnoticed by The Master, who watches with a keen, almost predatory interest. The flush that
spreads across Jason's cheeks, the way his body unconsciously tries to hide its most vulnerable part, the subtle shift
in his stance-they are all signs of his shame, his embarrassment, his deep, gut-wrenching humiliation. And The Master
relishes it. He feeds on it, drawing strength and satisfaction from every flicker of emotion that crosses Jason's face.

"I must say," The Master begins, his voice a low, measured purr, "it is rather disappointing to hear that you have been
disobeying the rules so soon. I had hoped that you would have learned by now that your body is not your own. That every
touch, every sensation, every desire belongs to me."

The Master leans back in his chair, his eyes never leaving Jason's face, his gaze a piercing, unblinking stare that
seems to see right through him. "And yet, here you are, caught in yet another act of defiance. Another moment of
weakness. Another failure to understand your place in this world."


I listen silently my gaze downcast


The Master's voice grows even more deliberate, each word a slow, measured strike meant to pierce through Jason's
defenses, to strip him of any lingering sense of dignity or self-worth.

"You stand before me, Jason, exposed and ashamed," he continues, his tone sharp and unyielding. "Your body betrays you,
even as your mind struggles to comprehend the truth of your situation. You are mine. Every part of you. Every thought,
every desire, every touch-it all belongs to me."

He stands from his desk and begins to circle Jason, his steps slow and deliberate, like a predator stalking its prey.
With each passing moment, the air in the room grows heavier, more charged, the tension palpable.

"Tell me, Jason," he says, his voice dropping to a low, intimate whisper as he stops directly behind him, "did you enjoy
it? Did you find pleasure in your disobedience? Did you imagine me watching you, controlling you, guiding your every
touch?"


"no" I whimp her quietly


The Master's lips curl into a thin, mocking smile at Jason's soft, desperate denial. He moves back to stand in front of
him, his eyes gleaming with a mixture of amusement and cold calculation.

"No?" he echoes, his voice a soft, dangerous murmur. "You expect me to believe that, Jason? You expect me to believe
that you did not find some twisted, perverse pleasure in your defiance? That you did not imagine my eyes on you, my
hands guiding you, my voice commanding you?"

The Master reaches out, his fingers tracing the line of Jason's jaw, his touch surprisingly gentle despite the harshness
of his words. His thumb brushes against Jason's lips, a soft, almost teasing caress that seems to mock the very idea of
denial.

"Your body tells a different story, Jason," he says, his voice a low, insistent whisper. "Your body tells me that you
enjoyed it. That you craved it. That you needed it."

The Master's hand drops away, and he takes a step back, his eyes never leaving Jason's face. "And now, you will be
punished for it."


I look up at it and then, concern clouding my face


The realization of what is to come washes over Jason's face like a wave, the concern in his eyes a mix of fear, anxiety,
and a deep, gnawing uncertainty. The Master watches him closely, his expression unreadable, his eyes gleaming with a
cold, calculating intelligence.

"Yes, Jason," he says, his voice a low, measured drawl. "You will be punished. And you will learn. You will learn that
disobedience has consequences. That resistance is futile. That your body, your mind, your very soul-all of it belongs to
me."

The Master moves back to his desk, his steps slow and deliberate, each one a silent, weighted statement of his
authority, his control. He opens a drawer, his hand disappearing inside for a moment before reemerging with a slender,
black leather riding crop. The sight of it sends a shiver down Jason's spine, a primal, instinctive reaction to the
symbol of his impending punishment.

"Come here, Jason," The Master commands, his voice a sharp, unyielding order. "Bend over the desk. It is time for your
lesson to begin."


(note: The Master should begin spanking Jason over his panties and then, eventually pull the down to Jason's knees and
continue)


The room seems to grow colder, the air heavy with anticipation and dread. Jason's heart pounds in his chest, each beat a
drumroll of fear and anticipation as he moves to stand before The Master's desk. The polished wood surface gleams under
the dim light, reflecting the faint tremble of his hands as he hesitates, his body tense with a mix of shame and
reluctant obedience.

The Master watches him, his eyes sharp and unblinking, his expression a mask of calm, unyielding control. The leather
riding crop rests in his hand, a slim, ominous shape that seems to cast a shadow over everything. Jason takes a deep
breath, his eyes downcast as he slowly bends over the desk, his hands gripping the far edge, his body stretched taut and
vulnerable.


Jason takes a breath and holds it. wondering what the riding crap will feel like


The waiting is excruciating, each second stretching into an eternity as Jason holds his breath, his body rigid with
anticipation. The room is silent except for the faint ticking of the clock, the distant hum of the house, and the
distant, echoing rhythm of his own heartbeat. The Master stands behind him, his presence a silent, looming force, his
eyes taking in every detail of Jason's exposed, vulnerable form.

Without warning, the riding crop whistles through the air, the sound a sharp, cracking note that cuts through the
silence. It lands with a stinging blow across the soft, delicate fabric of Jason's pink lace panties, the impact sending
a jolt of pain and shock through his body. He gasps, his breath exploding from his lungs in a sharp, involuntary cry,
his fingers digging into the edge of the desk as he struggles to maintain his composure.


I am shocked at the sharpness of the pain, but I know that despite the sudden sting, my arousal is not dissipated


The Master's hand pauses for a moment, allowing Jason to absorb the shock of the first blow, the sting of the leather
against his flesh. His voice, when it comes, is a low, measured drawl, a tone that seems to wrap around Jason,
tightening like a noose.

"Count them, Jason," he commands, his voice a sharp, unyielding order. "And thank me for each one. Understood?"

The riding crop whistles through the air again, the sound a sharp, cracking note that cuts through the silence. It lands
with another stinging blow across the same spot, the impact sending another jolt of pain and shock through Jason's body.
He gasps again, his fingers digging into the edge of the desk, his body tensing as he struggles to maintain his
composure.

"One," he manages to grit out, his voice a strained, desperate whisper. "Thank you, sir."

The Master's hand moves again, the riding crop striking Jason with a swift, precise blow. The pain is intense, a sharp,
burning sensation that seems to radiate out from the point of impact, spreading through his body like wildfire.

"Two,"


The pain is intense and the warmth spreads across my backside. I begin to wonder just how many strokes I will have to
endure


The Master's rhythm is steady and unyielding, each strike of the riding crop landing with precise, measured force across
the tender flesh of Jason's backside. The room fills with the sharp, staccato cracks of leather against lace, the air
thick with the scent of his awakened arousal and the faint, musky tang of his own sweat. "Three." It is as if time has
slowed, each second stretching into an eternity of pain and humiliation.

"Three, sir," Jason gasps out, his voice trembling with each word. "Thank you, sir."

The Master pauses for a moment, his breath steady and controlled, a stark contrast to Jason's ragged, desperate gasps.
He leans down, his voice a low, intimate whisper in Jason's ear.

"You are doing well, Jason," he murmurs, his words a soft, twisted compliment. "So responsive. So obedient. But we are
only just beginning."


I shut her slightly and grip the edges of the desk harder


The Master's words send a shiver down Jason's spine, a mix of dread and dark anticipation. He can feel the warmth
spreading across his backside, the sting of each blow fading into a deep, throbbing ache. His body tenses as he braces
himself for the next strike, his fingers digging into the edge of the desk, knuckles turning white with the effort to
maintain his composure.

Suddenly, the rhythm changes. The riding crop strikes again, but this time, The Master's aim is lower, the blow landing
directly on the sensitive skin where Jason's thigh meets his buttock. The pain is electric, a sharp, searing jolt that
sends a wave of heat crashing through his body. He cries out, his voice a raw, desperate sound that echoes through the
room.

"Four," he manages to gasp, his voice shaking with the effort to comply. "Thank you, sir."

The Master's hand pauses, and Jason can feel him moving closer, his presence a looming, oppressive force. The riding
crop traces a slow, deliberate path down Jason's thigh, the touch light and almost teasing, a stark contrast to the
sharp, biting pain of the blows.


I feel goose flash rise on the front of my thighs and arms. in horror I realize that I might be enjoying this


The Master's fingers trace the line of Jason's thigh, the touch light and almost teasing, a stark contrast to the sharp,
biting pain of the blows. He leans down, his breath warm against Jason's ear, his voice a low, intimate whisper that
seems to wrap around him, pulling him deeper into the abyss of his own desires.

"You are learning, Jason," he murmurs, his words a soft, twisted compliment. "You are learning to embrace the pain. To
accept it. To crave it."

The Master's hand moves to the waistband of Jason's panties, his fingers hooking into the delicate lace, a silent,
unspoken promise of what is to come. He pulls them down slowly, the fabric sliding over the curve of Jason's buttocks,
exposing the tender, flushed flesh to the cool air of the room. Jason's breath hitches, his body tensing as he braces
himself for the next strike, the next wave of pain and pleasure.


as I feel The Master pull my panties down, my shock combines intensely with arousal, and I feel my cock grow rock hard


The Master pulls the panties down with a slow, deliberate grace, his fingers never rough, never unmeasured. The fabric
slides over Jason's thighs, revealing his bare, vulnerable body in the full light of the study. The Master takes his
time, folding the panties neatly and placing them on the corner of the desk, as if they are an article of clothing to be
set aside for later. He does not touch them again, but the sight of them-so soft, so feminine-resting on the wood
beneath his command, adds another layer of degradation to the moment.

Jason stands, knees bent slightly, the cool air of the study brushing over his bare skin. His cock is rock hard now,
fully erect, the arousal undeniable and raw. A thin sheen of sweat has broken out across his forehead, his chest rising
and falling in rapid, shallow breaths. The combination of shame, humiliation, and the strange, electric thrill of his
own body's betrayal is almost too much to bear. He wants to look away, to disappear, to will himself into nothingness.
But The Master's presence is a wall he cannot escape.

The Master circles back around, his footsteps silent on the carpeted floor.


I breathe raggedly listening to the steps as The Master approaches my grip on the desk tightening


The room feels even more oppressive as The Master moves around behind Jason, each footfall a measured beat, a silent
countdown to the next inevitable strike. Jason's breath comes in short, desperate gasps, his fingers digging into the
polished wood of The Master's desk, the surface cold and unyielding beneath his touch. The anticipation is a tangible
thing, a thick, choking mix of fear and dark, twisted excitement.

The Master stops directly behind him, his presence looming large and imposing. Jason can feel the heat of his body, the
faint scent of expensive cologne mingling with the sharper, more primal scent of his own arousal. The riding crop
whispers through the air, a soft, menacing sound that seems to echo in the silence, a promise of the pain to come.

The first blow lands with a sharp, cracking sound, the leather connecting with Jason's bare flesh with a searing
intensity. The pain is white-hot, a blinding flash that cuts through the fog of his thoughts, leaving only raw, primal
sensation. He cries out, his voice a raw, desperate sound that echoes through the room. "Five,"


"Thank you sir" I managed to gasp out


The Master's lips curve into a faint, satisfied smile at Jason's choked response, the sound of his voice a mix of pain
and reluctant obedience. The riding crop whistles through the air again, the sound a sharp, cracking note that cuts
through the silence. It lands with another stinging blow, the impact sending a jolt of pain and shock through Jason's
body.

"Six," The Master says, his voice a low, measured drawl, a tone that seems to wrap around Jason, tightening like a
noose. "Thank you, sir."

The rhythm of the blows is unyielding, each strike landing with precise, measured force across the tender flesh of
Jason's backside. The room fills with the sharp, staccato cracks of leather against skin, the air thick with the scent
of his awakened arousal and the faint, musky tang of his own sweat. Jason's body tenses with each blow, his fingers
digging into the edge of the desk, his breath coming in ragged, desperate gasps.


(note: The Master should pause at 20 and call Evelyn into the room. Jason should be relieved believing that his
punishment is over. The Master should reach around and feel Jason's cock and humiliate him over his excitement and
leaking member. He should order Evelyn to gather some precum on her finger put it in Jason's mouth.)


The riding crop continues its steady, unyielding rhythm, each blow landing with precise, measured force across Jason's
tender flesh. The room is filled with the sharp, staccato cracks of leather against skin, the air thick with the scent
of his arousal and the faint, musky tang of his sweat. Jason's body tenses with each strike, his fingers digging into
the edge of the desk, his breath coming in ragged, desperate gasps.

"Thirty-nine," Jason gasps out, his voice trembling with each word. "Thank you... thank you, sir."

The Master pauses after the twentieth blow, the riding crop held loosely in his hand, his breath steady and controlled.
Jason's body trembles, his backside a fiery, throbbing mass of pain and sensation. He dares to hope, to believe that the
punishment is over, that the ordeal is finally at an end. His body relaxes slightly, his grip on the desk easing, his
breath beginning to slow.

But The Master's voice, when it comes, is a low, cold command that shatters his fragile hope.

"Evelyn,"


.


The Master's voice cuts through the silence, sharp and commanding. "Evelyn."

The door to the study opens almost immediately, as if Evelyn had been waiting just outside, ready to respond to the
Master's call. She steps into the room, her heels clicking softly against the polished floor, her posture upright and
poised. Her eyes flick over Jason, taking in his exposed, vulnerable state, the red, welts on his backside, the sheen of
sweat on his skin. Her expression remains impassive, her gaze cool and assessing.

"Yes, sir?" she responds, her voice a low, measured tone that seems to echo The Master's own calm, unyielding authority.

The Master's hand moves to Jason's hip, his fingers digging into the soft flesh, a possessive, dominating touch. He
leans down, his breath warm against Jason's ear, his voice a low, intimate whisper.

"Look at you, Jason," he murmurs, his words a soft, twisted compliment. "So obedient. So responsive. So eager to please.
And yet, so ashamed of your own desires."


.


The Master's hand trails down from Jason's hip, his fingers brushing against the sensitive skin of his inner thigh,
sending a shiver of anticipation and dread through Jason's body. The Master's touch is deliberate, almost teasing, as he
moves closer to Jason's throbbing, erect cock. Jason's breath hitches, his body tensing as he braces himself for what is
to come.

"The evidence of your excitement is quite clear, Jason," The Master says, his voice a low, mocking purr. He wraps his
fingers around Jason's cock, his grip firm and possessive. Jason's body betrays him, a small, involuntary moan escaping
his lips as he feels The Master's hand on his most intimate part. The Master chuckles, a cold, amused sound that sends a
chill down Jason's spine.

He strokes Jason's cock slowly, his thumb circling the sensitive tip, spreading the bead of precum that has formed
there. Jason's body responds, his hips involuntarily pushing into The Master's hand, seeking more of the forbidden
pleasure.

"Such a shameful display," The Master comments, his voice dripping with disdain.


I whimper unable to form any words beyond that


The Master's grip tightens slightly, his hand moving in a slow, deliberate rhythm that sends waves of pleasure and
humiliation crashing through Jason's body. The room seems to spin around him, the pain from the earlier blows fading
into a distant, throbbing ache, overshadowed by the intense, shameful pleasure of The Master's touch.

"Evelyn," The Master calls out, his voice a sharp, commanding order. He pauses his strokes on Jason's cock, allowing it
to thrust into his hand, "Come here."

Evelyn moves swiftly and gracefully across the room. Her gaze is locked on Jason, taking in every detail of his flushed,
embarrassed face, his heaving chest, and the telltale signs of his arousal. She stands beside The Master, her presence a
silent, looming force, her eyes gleaming with a mixture of amusement and cold calculation.

"Yes, sir?" she responds, her voice a soft, measured tone that seems to blend seamlessly with The Master's own calm,
unyielding authority.


.


Evelyn does not move forward immediately. She lingers at The Master's side, her body poised and unreadable, her gaze
fixed on Jason with a quiet intensity. Her skirt rustles slightly as she shifts her weight, the soft sound a stark
contrast to the silence between them. Jason can feel her eyes on him, cool and assessing, as if she is dissecting the
moment, the man, the act of submission unfolding before her.

The Master's hand does not stop. His fingers continue their slow, measured movement, coaxing more of Jason's leaking
precum to the tip, the evidence of his shame and arousal spread across his palm. He raises a single finger, coated in
Jason's slick, glistening secretion, and offers it to Evelyn with a subtle nod.

"Take it," The Master says, his voice a low, commanding drawl. "Show him what he has done."


.


The Master's command hangs heavy in the air. Jason's breath comes in short, desperate gasps as he watches Evelyn step
forward, her heels clicking softly on the floor. She moves with a grace that is almost predatory, her eyes never leaving
Jason's face. There is a glint in her eyes, a mixture of curiosity and dominance that sends a shiver down Jason's spine.

Evelyn's hand extends, her fingers delicate and manicured, as she takes The Master's finger into her grasp. The motion
is precise, almost clinical, as she carefully transfers the sticky, glistening precum onto her own finger. She holds it
up for a moment, examining it with a dispassionate gaze, as if it were a specimen under a microscope.

The Master's voice is cold and calculated, his words a slow, measured drawl that cuts through the silence. "Open your
mouth, Jason."


I wordlessly open my mouth. I am beyond resistance at this point


The Master nods slightly, a subtle gesture of approval that sends a wave of mixed emotions crashing through Jason.
Evelyn steps closer, her presence dominating the space around him. She moves her hand towards Jason's mouth, her finger
coated with his own precum, a visible, humiliating testament to his arousal and submission.

Evelyn's fingers brush against his lips, the touch light and almost teasing. She presses gently, sliding her finger into
his mouth, her eyes locked onto his, watching his reaction with a keen, unblinking stare. Jason's breath hitches as he
tastes the salty, familiar essence of his own excitement, the humiliation of the act washing over him in waves.

"Lick it clean," The Master commands, his voice a low, unyielding growl. "Show us how much you enjoy this. Show us how
much you crave it."


I began licking Evelyn's finger. My excitement gets the better of me and I begin to suck on it


The Master's eyes narrow slightly, his gaze intense and unblinking as he watches the scene unfold. Evelyn's finger
remains in Jason's mouth, her expression impassive, but there is a faint, almost imperceptible smile playing at the
corners of her lips. She allows Jason to suck on her finger, his tongue swirling around the digit, his lips sealing
tightly around it.

The Master's voice is a low, measured drawl, a tone that seems to wrap around Jason, tightening like a noose. "Good
boy," he murmurs, his words a soft, twisted compliment. "So eager to please. So willing to submit."

Evelyn's hand remains still, her finger deep in Jason's mouth, her eyes never leaving his face. She watches him with a
mixture of amusement and cold calculation, her breath steady and controlled. The room is filled with the soft, wet
sounds of Jason's sucking, the faint, ragged breaths of his desperate arousal, and the distant ticking of the clock, a
silent, unyielding countdown to the next inevitable command.


(The Master should fetch up more of Jason's pre-com on his own fingertip and slide it into Jason's mouth)


The Master's eyes never leave Jason, his gaze intense and piercing, as he moves his hand back to Jason's throbbing cock.
Evelyn's finger remains in Jason's mouth. He can taste his own excitement, the salty, musky flavor a constant reminder
of his humiliation and arousal. The Master's touch is firm and deliberate, his fingers wrapping around Jason's shaft,
stroking slowly, coaxing more of the sticky, glistening precum to the tip.

The Master collects the precum on his own fingertip, the motion fluid and unhurried, as if he has done this a thousand
times before. He raises his finger to Jason's mouth, his eyes locked onto Jason's, his expression a mask of cold,
unyielding control.

"Open wider," he commands, his voice a low, unyielding growl.

Jason complies, his mouth opening wider, his breath coming in short, desperate gasps. The Master slides his finger into
Jason's mouth, the tip brushing against his tongue, the salty, familiar taste of his own arousal filling his senses.
Jason's body betrays him, his hips involuntarily pushing into The Master's hand, seeking more of the forbidden pleasure.


.


The Master's finger slides deeper into Jason's mouth, the sensation both intimate and humiliating. Jason's tongue
instinctively wraps around it, laving and suckling as if driven by an involuntary need to please. The Master's eyes
gleam with a mixture of satisfaction and dominance, his control over Jason's body and mind evident in every deliberate
movement.

"The pleasure you feel is mine to give," The Master murmurs, his voice a low, hypnotic purr. "Your body, your desires,
your very being-all of it belongs to me. You will learn to accept this, Jason. You will learn to embrace it."

The Master's hand continues to stroke Jason's cock, his movements steady and unyielding, coaxing more of the sticky,
glistening precum to the tip. Each touch, each stroke, is a reminder of Jason's submission, his body responding despite
the turmoil in his mind. Evelyn watches the scene with a calm, almost detached interest, her presence a silent, looming
reminder of the power dynamics at play.


(The Master should continue stroking Jason until he is nearly at the point of orgasm. at that point he should withdraw
his hand walk around to the other side of the desk. he should then order Evelyn to finish Jason off. Evelyn should put
on a pair of latex gloves and then get down on her knees before. Jason. Evelyn should bring Jason to orgasm precisely
and dispassionately with her hand. when Jason orgasms she should direct his com into the palm of her gloved hand where
she collects it. she should work all of the cum out of him that she can. when she's finished she should stand up and
display the semen for The Master who's been watching intently the whole time. The Master should approve of it nod to
Evelyn and then watch as Evelyn orders. Jason to open his mouth have swallow every drop of cum)


The Master's strokes become more deliberate, his hand moving with a steady, unyielding rhythm that pushes Jason closer
and closer to the edge of orgasm. The room is filled with the sound of skin against skin, the faint, ragged breaths of
Jason's desperate arousal, and the distant ticking of the clock, a silent, unyielding countdown to the inevitable
release. Jason's body tenses, his muscles coiling tight as the pleasure builds, a wave of ecstasy threatening to crash
over him at any moment.

Just as Jason feels himself teetering on the brink, The Master abruptly withdraws his hand, leaving Jason's cock
throbbing and aching with unspent desire. The sudden absence of touch sends a shiver of frustration and need through
Jason's body, his breath hitching in a desperate, gasping moan.

The Master walks around to the other side of the desk, his steps measured and calm, his eyes never leaving Jason's face.
He takes his seat, his posture relaxed yet commanding, as if he is a king observing a spectacle laid out for his
amusement. His voice is a low, unyielding command.


.


The Master's voice, cool and authoritative cuts through the tense air. "Evelyn."

Evelyn steps forward, her movements precise and deliberate. She does not hesitate, her training and discipline evident
in every graceful step. She retrieves a pair of latex gloves from a drawer in the desk, the snap of the rubber against
her skin a sharp, clinical sound. She slips them on, each finger encased in the smooth, glossy material.

Evelyn kneels before Jason, her eyes level with his throbbing, leaking cock. Her movements are precise and calculated,
her touch dispassionate and methodical. She wraps her gloved hand around his shaft, her grip firm and unyielding.
Jason's breath hitches, his body tensing as he feels the cool latex against his heated flesh.

The Master watches intently, his eyes gleaming with a mixture of amusement and cold calculation. Evelyn begins to stroke
Jason with expert precision, her hand moving in a steady, unyielding rhythm. The room fills with the soft, wet sounds of
her gloved hand against his sensitive skin, the faint, ragged breaths of Jason's desperate arousal, and the distant
ticking of the clock.


.


Evelyn's hand moves with a practiced, almost mechanical efficiency, her strokes precise and unyielding. Jason's body
responds involuntarily, his hips pushing into her touch, his breath coming in short, desperate gasps. The pleasure
builds, a wave of ecstasy that threatens to consume him, to drown him in a sea of shame and desire.

The Master watches, his expression unreadable, his eyes locked onto the scene unfolding before him. His presence is a
silent, looming force, his authority a tangible thing that fills the room, a constant reminder of the power dynamics at
play.

Jason's body tenses, his muscles coiling tight as the pleasure reaches its peak. With a ragged, desperate cry, he
orgasms, his cock pulsing and throbbing in Evelyn's gloved hand. She continues to stroke him, her movements precise and
unyielding, milking every last drop of his release. She collects the semen in the palm of her gloved hand, her touch
dispassionate and clinical, ensuring that none of it is wasted.


.


As the final waves of Jason's orgasm subside, Evelyn's hand slows, her grip relaxing slightly but still firm. She stands
up gracefully, her movements fluid and controlled. The room is filled with the sound of their combined breathing, the
air thick with the scent of sex and the faint, sterile smell of the latex gloves.

Evelyn holds out her gloved hand, the palm cupped to display the collected semen, a glistening, viscous pool of Jason's
submission and humiliation. She turns to The Master, her eyes meeting his, awaiting his approval.

The Master's gaze flickers over the contents of Evelyn's hand, his expression a mix of satisfaction and cold
calculation. He nods, a subtle, almost imperceptible gesture, but one that speaks volumes in the charged atmosphere of
the study.

"Good," he murmurs, his voice a low, approving purr. "Very good, Evelyn."

Evelyn turns back to Jason, her voice a sharp, commanding tone that brooks no argument.

"Open your mouth, Jason," she orders, her hand still held out, the semen glistening under the dim light of the study.


with horror, I realize what she is expecting of me. My mouth tightens and my eyes flash defiantly


The Master's gaze, unwavering and cold, drills into Jason's defiant expression. His lips curve into a thin, mocking
smile, a silent reminder of the power dynamics at play. Evelyn stands before Jason, her hand still outstretched, the
gloved palm filled with the evidence of his submission. Her eyes, sharp and unyielding, mirror The Master's, a silent,
unspoken message that his resistance is futile.

"This is not a request, Jason," Evelyn says, her voice a low, measured drawl. "This is an order. You will obey, or you
will face the consequences."

The Master leans back in his chair, his fingers steepled in front of him, his eyes never leaving Jason's face. The room
is filled with a tense, charged silence, the air thick with anticipation and the faint, musky scent of arousal and
humiliation.

"Open your mouth, Jason," Evelyn repeats, her voice a sharp, unyielding command. "Swallow every drop. Show us your
obedience. Show us your submission."


with a look with a pained look I open my mouth obediently


The Master's eyes gleam with satisfaction as he watches Jason's reluctant compliance, the pained look on his face a
testament to his inner turmoil. Evelyn steps closer, her hand moving towards Jason's open mouth, the gloved palm filled
with the glistening, viscous semen. The room is filled with the soft, wet sounds of her movements, the faint, ragged
breaths of Jason's desperate submission, and the distant ticking of the clock, a silent, unyielding countdown to the
inevitable.

Evelyn tips her hand, allowing the semen to drip into Jason's mouth, the warm, salty liquid filling his senses. Jason's
body tenses, his eyes fluttering closed as he swallows, the act of submission a bitter pill to swallow. The Master
watches intently, his expression unreadable, his eyes locked onto Jason's face, taking in every detail of his
humiliation and obedience.


I swallow the liquid, letting it coat my throat and forcing myself to endure it.


The Master's gaze remains fixed on Jason, his expression a mix of satisfaction and cold calculation. The room is filled
with a tense, charged silence, the air thick with the scent of submission and the faint, musky tang of arousal. Evelyn
stands motionless, her hand still outstretched, her eyes locked onto Jason's face, watching his every reaction with a
keen, unblinking stare.

The Master leans forward slightly, his voice a low, measured drawl that seems to wrap around Jason, tightening like a
noose.

"Very good, Jason," he murmurs, his words a soft, twisted compliment. "You are learning. You are adapting. You are
embracing your new role. But remember, this is just the beginning. There is so much more to explore. So much more to
experience."

The Master's eyes flicker to Evelyn, a subtle, almost imperceptible nod passing between them. Evelyn steps back, her
movements graceful and controlled, her expression impassive. She removes the latex gloves, discarding them with a
practiced, almost clinical efficiency.

"Clean yourself up, Jason," Evelyn commands, her voice a sharp, unyielding tone.


I take the offered cloth and clean the residue off of my penis. that finished. I tuck it back in my panties


The Master watches Jason with a mixture of amusement and cold calculation, his eyes never leaving the young man's face
as he follows Evelyn's command. Jason takes the cloth offered by Evelyn, his movements slow and deliberate, his face
flushed with a mix of humiliation and residual arousal. He cleans the residue from his penis, the cloth damp and cool
against his heated flesh, a stark contrast to the warmth that still lingers in his body.

The room is filled with a tense, charged silence, the air thick with the scent of sex and the faint, musky tang of
arousal. Jason's hands tremble slightly as he tucks his now-clean penis back into the lace panties, the delicate fabric
a constant reminder of his submission and humiliation. The Master's gaze follows every movement, his expression
unreadable, but his eyes gleaming with a mixture of satisfaction and dominance.

"Very good, Jason," The Master murmurs, his voice a low, approving purr. "You are learning to obey. You are learning to
submit. And soon, you will learn to embrace it. To crave it."


(note: The Master should now announced that he has his own needs that need to be attended to. he should excuse Jason to
wait outside the door. as Jason walks towards the door, The Master should order Evelyn to bend over the desk. as Jason
goes through the door, he should catch a last sight of Evelyn obediently bent over the desk as The Master lifts the Hem
of her skirt up over her ass. once in the hallway Jason should listen quietly as sounds of intense sex emerge from the
study. Jason should be shocked to hear. Evelyn moaning and begging for The Master's cock.)


The Master's voice cuts through the tense silence, his tone shifting from cold calculation to a more intimate,
commanding drawl. "Jason, I have my own needs that require attention. You will wait outside the door until I call for
you."

Jason hesitates for a moment, his body tense and his mind racing. The Master's gaze is unwavering, his eyes locked onto
Jason's, a silent reminder of the power dynamics at play. Jason nods, his movements slow and deliberate as he turns
towards the door, his heart pounding in his chest.

As Jason reaches for the door handle, The Master's voice rings out again, sharp and commanding. "Evelyn, bend over the
desk."

Jason's hand pauses on the handle, his breath hitching as he turns back to see Evelyn moving swiftly and gracefully to
the desk. She bends over, her body poised and obedient, her skirt falling neatly around her thighs. The Master steps
behind her, his hands moving to the hem of her skirt, lifting it slowly, revealing the smooth, pale flesh of her ass.


.


The sight of Evelyn bent over the desk, her skirt lifted to reveal her bare, vulnerable flesh, sends a shockwave through
Jason. He stands frozen for a moment, his hand still on the doorknob, his eyes wide with a mix of disbelief and arousal.
The Master's hands move with deliberate precision, his fingers tracing the curve of Evelyn's ass, his touch possessive
and dominating.

The Master's voice is a low, commanding growl. "You know what I want, Evelyn. You know how to please me."

Jason's heart pounds in his chest as he finally turns the doorknob and steps out into the hallway, the door clicking
softly behind him. The hallway is dimly lit, the air cool and quiet, a stark contrast to the charged atmosphere of the
study. He stands there, his back against the door, his breath coming in short, ragged gasps.


.


The sounds from within the study are muffled at first, but as Jason stands there, his ear pressed against the door, the
noises become clearer, more distinct. The faint, rhythmic thudding of flesh against flesh, the soft, wet sounds of skin
sliding against skin, and the distant, faint moans of pleasure that escape Evelyn's lips. Jason's heart races, his body
tensing as he listens, his mind a whirlwind of shock and arousal.

The Master's voice, low and commanding, cuts through the sounds, his words a sharp, unyielding command. "Beg for it,
Evelyn. Beg for my cock."

Jason's breath hitches as he hears Evelyn's response, her voice a mix of desperation and submission. "Please, sir.
Please, I need your cock. I need you to fuck me."


.


The sounds from within the study grow more intense, the moans and pleas from Evelyn becoming more desperate and urgent.
Jason stands frozen in the hallway, his ear pressed against the door, his heart pounding in his chest. The raw,
unfiltered sounds of their coupling send shivers down his spine, a mix of shock, arousal, and a deep, primal curiosity
stirring within him.

The Master's voice is a low, dominant growl, punctuated by the sharp, rhythmic slaps of flesh against flesh. "That's
right, Evelyn. Beg for it. Show me how much you want it."

Evelyn's responses are a symphony of submission and desire, her voice trembling with each plea. "Please, sir... I need
it. I need you inside me. Fuck me, please. Use me."

The intensity of the sounds escalates, the moans and gasps growing louder, more urgent. Jason can almost visualize the
scene unfolding behind the door, The Master's powerful body moving with a relentless, dominating rhythm, Evelyn's form
bent over the desk, her grip tight on the edge, her body quivering with each thrust.


.


The Master's deep, rhythmic groans now mix with the soft, wet slaps of flesh, a primal, almost hypnotic cadence that
Jason can neither escape nor fully understand. His body betrays him, his cock still stiff in his panties, his breath
shallow and uneven. He is both repulsed and consumed by the sounds, his face burning with the heat of shame and
something else-something he dares not name.

The door creaks slightly as The Master and Evelyn move behind it, their bodies slick with sweat, their shared rhythm
building toward something inevitable. Evelyn's voice is no longer the cool, impassive tone he's come to associate with
her authority-it's raw, trembling, and willing.

"Harder, sir," she whispers. "Faster... I'm close... I'm so close-"

Her moan cuts off mid-sentence, replaced by a sharp, gasping cry. The Master growls, his voice thick and indulgent.
"You'll come when I say you come."

Jason's hands tremble against the door, his fingers curling into the wood as he listens, his mind racing to make sense
of what he's hearing.


.


Jason's body is a battleground, his pulse hammering in his ears as the study becomes a theater of forbidden sound. He
can no longer pretend this is not happening. The Master's voice, deep and commanding, is a force that reverberates
through the room, each syllable a hammer striking the anvil of Jason's resolve. Evelyn's moans are soft and urgent, the
kind that should be hidden, silenced, forbidden-yet here they are, spilling into the hallway like a secret he is no
longer allowed to forget.

The scent of sweat and arousal clings to the air beneath the study door, and Jason can almost feel it pressing against
his own skin, against the lace-edged fabric of his panties, against the soft, exposed flesh of his backside still
stinging from The Master's hand. His cock throbs inside the tight confines of the garment, his body responding to the
sounds with a hunger he cannot suppress. He wants to leave. He should leave. But his feet are rooted, his body betraying
him, his breath shallow and uneven.

Inside, The Master grunts, his voice thick with satisfaction.


.


The Master grunts, his voice thick with satisfaction as he sets a brutal, unrelenting pace. Jason can hear the wet,
slick slap of The Master's thick cock driving into Evelyn, the sound reverberating in his skull like a drumbeat meant to
break him. He strains to hear more, his own arousal aching and leaking inside the lace of his panties, his body
betraying him with every pulse of pleasure that echoes from the other side of the door.

Evelyn's voice is high now, trembling, almost desperate, each plea a sharp, intimate whisper. "More... oh, please,
more... I want it all, sir... I want you to fill me..." Her breath hitches, a soft, feminine cry escaping her lips as
The Master drives into her with a controlled, predatory rhythm. "I'm coming... I'm coming-"


.


Jason's breath is a ragged, stuttering thing now, his pulse hammering in his throat as Evelyn's voice cracks on the edge
of climax. Her moans are not just sounds-they are confessions, exposures, each one stripping away the last of her cold,
professional veneer and revealing the woman beneath. The Master's grunts and heavy breathing grow louder, more
insistent, his movements behind the desk no longer measured but driven by something darker, more consuming. Jason can
almost feel the heat of the room through the wood, the sweat, the scent of sex, the raw, animalistic hunger in their
coupling.

His cock throbs in his panties, the fabric soaked and warm against his skin. His hands curl into fists at his sides, his
knuckles white from the strain of holding himself still, holding himself back. He wants to turn away. He wants to deny
what he's hearing, what he's feeling. But he can't. He is rooted in place, his body locked in by something deeper than
fear-something like fascination, like a need to see it through, to understand it.


.


The sounds from within the study reach a fever pitch, The Master's grunts becoming more guttural, more primal. Evelyn's
cries are a mix of pleasure and desperation, her voice trembling as she begs for more, for everything. The room is
filled with the raw, unfiltered sounds of their coupling, the air thick with the scent of sex and the faint, musky tang
of arousal.

The Master's voice is a low, commanding growl, punctuated by the sharp, rhythmic slaps of flesh against flesh. "Come for
me, Evelyn. Show me how much you want it. Show me how much you need it."

The Master's voice is a low, commanding growl, punctuated by the sharp, rhythmic slaps of flesh against flesh. "Come for
me, Evelyn. Show me how much you want it. Show me how much you need it."

The Master's voice is a low, commanding growl, punctuated by the sharp, rhythmic slaps of flesh against flesh. "Come for
me, Evelyn. Show me how much you want it. Show me how much you need it."


(note: The Master should follow Evelyn's orgasm with his own. His grunts should turn to animalistic roars and Jason
should hear the desk moving from his forceable thrusts. Evelyn should lose composure and scream. Jason has never heard
sex like this, and his arousal should teeter on the brink of his own climax but not spill over.)


The Master's rhythm intensifies, his voice breaking into a deep, guttural growl, each thrust against the desk sending a
resounding thud through the wood and into Jason's ears. The desk creaks under the force, its polished surface groaning
like it, too, is being broken. The room behind the door is no longer a space of control and discipline-it is a
battlefield of raw, unbridled desire, and Jason is both witness and prisoner to it.

"Yes," The Master rumbles, his voice thick with something feral. "Yes... yes..." He groans louder, his words dissolving
into a low, primal roar that shakes the air in the study. The sound is not a man's-it is something older, something
darker, something that makes Jason's knees weak.

Evelyn's voice shatters into a high, breathless scream, a sound that is both exquisite and terrifying. "Oh God, yes!
Yes! Please-!" Her cries are no longer measured, no longer composed. They are raw, desperate, real.


Jason's hand sneaks down to his panties and feels his throbbing cock. The front of his panties are quite wet. He's so
tempted to follow the feeling of pleasure beneath his hand, but he knows he would pay dearly for it.


Jason's hand trembles as it slides down the front of his pink lace panties. The fabric is warm, soaked through with the
evidence of his own helplessness. His cock is rigid, pulsing, aching-every touch of Evelyn's gloved hand, every sound of
The Master's brutal fucking, every breath of heated air from behind the study door has led him to this edge. He
hesitates, his fingers hovering just above the damp front of the garment, the temptation a searing, unbearable thing.

But then, just as his hand brushes the soaked lace, the door creaks open behind him. Jason stiffens, his hand snapping
back to his side as if burned. The Master's voice is low, a deep, silken growl that cuts through the hallway like a
whip.

"Do not touch yourself," The Master says, his tone calm but weighted with command. "Not without permission. You know
this."


Y.. yes sir, I say in a panic stricken voice as I straighten up before him


The Master's eyes are locked on Jason, sharp and unyielding, as if he could see right through the trembling, half-formed
excuse in his voice. Jason's body is taut with fear, his pulse hammering in his ears, the scent of sweat and arousal
thick in the air between them. The hallway feels suddenly claustrophobic, the walls pressing in with the weight of the
Master's gaze. His cock still throbs behind the damp fabric of his panties, the pressure unbearable, but he dares not
move, dares not breathe too heavily, dares not even blink without permission.

The Master rises slowly, his chair creaking beneath him. He steps forward, his presence a shadow that swallows the space
Jason occupies. His hand comes up, not in punishment, but in inspection-fingers brushing lightly over Jason's cheek,
then down his neck, his collarbone, his chest, all the while his voice a smooth, venomous whisper. "You're so close,
Jason. I can see it. Feel it in your voice. You want to come, don't you?"

Jason's breath is shallow, his body coiled like a spring. He dares not answer.


(note: Jason should notice that Evelyn is somewhat disheveled even though t she has composed herself remarkably given
the passion he overheard. her face is compose, but quite flushed)


The Master's hand still rests lightly on Jason's chest, but his attention shifts. A sharp nod, and Jason's eyes
follow-past The Master's broad, immovable frame-to the figure of Evelyn standing in the doorway of the study. She has
composed herself with the same effortless precision that has always defined her, but there are traces of what Jason just
witnessed clinging to her like the last drops of rain on a windowpane. Her skirt is still pulled up, the hem slightly
crumpled at the top, and her posture is rigid, the kind of perfect stillness that only comes after something has nearly
unraveled it.

Yet, she stands tall. Her face is pale, her lips slightly parted, her breath steady. But the flush on her cheeks is
unmistakable, deep and hot, spreading from her neck to the high planes of her face. It is not the flush of
embarrassment, but of something far more dangerous-pleasure under control, still smoldering, still fresh.

Jason's eyes flicker over her, and he swallows hard. The sight of her, so carefully put together yet so recently
shattered by The Master's hands, sends a fresh jolt through his already taut nerves.


(The Master should now announce he is leaving he should instruct Evelyn to give Jason 10 more severe strokes for
touching himself again , and then put him back to work)


The Master straightens, his movements slow and deliberate, as if savoring the final moments of his display. He turns to
Evelyn, his voice low and smooth, yet edged with finality. "I have need of rest, Evelyn. See to Jason. Ten more strokes.
He must learn restraint." Then, with a final glance at Jason, The Master walks past them both, his heavy footsteps
echoing in the hallway as he disappears around the corner, the door to his private study closing behind him with a soft,
final click.

Evelyn steps forward, her gaze hardening as it settles on Jason. The flush in her cheeks has not entirely faded, but the
softness has vanished from her eyes. In her hand, the riding crop sways slightly as she reaches for it, the leather
strands gleaming in the dim hallway light. She moves with the same quiet authority as always, but now Jason feels the
full weight of it-because he knows what she has done. What she is doing. To him.

"You will take your punishment like the good little boy you are," she says, her voice cool, even.


I swallow hard, aware of the heat and tenderness still present in my backside I utter, "yes ma'am and lean over the
desk"


Jason leans over the desk, his hands gripping the edge as his backside is once again presented to Evelyn. His body is
still tender from the last punishment, the sting a sharp reminder of his place. He can feel the cool wood against his
knees, the slight give of the polished surface under his palms. His cock throbs inside his soaked panties, the fabric
clinging to him like a second skin, a constant, humiliating presence that he cannot ignore.

Evelyn moves behind him, the soft rustle of her skirt the only sound she makes. The riding crop in her hand is a long,
cruel promise of more to come. Her breath is steady, controlled, her body poised with the same cold precision that has
always defined her. Yet there is something else in her now-something Jason can't quite place, something that flickers
just beneath her calm exterior.

"One through ten, Jason," she says, her voice even, but with a subtle edge that tightens the air around him. "You will
count each one. You will thank me for each one. And you will not move unless I command you to."


yes, maam


Evelyn raises the riding crop, the leather strands catching the light as they part with a soft, whispering snap. Jason's
breath hitches instinctively. The first stroke falls with a sharp, stinging crack across his already-sensitive backside.
He flinches, but holds his position, his fingers pressing harder into the desk as the second stroke follows, then the
third-each one landing with surgical precision, each one burning like a brand into the flesh beneath the lace-edged
fabric of his soaked panties.

"One," she says, her voice flat, unemotional, as if she were reciting a grocery list. "Two." "Three."

Jason's teeth grit together, his face flushed, his body trembling. His cock pulses in his panties, the wet heat
undeniable, unbearable. He wants to move, to shift, to cry out more than the numbers she demands, but he cannot. Not
without permission.

By the time she reaches ten, The Master's study is silent save for the soft thud of Evelyn setting the crop down. Her
fingers press lightly into the curve of Jason's back, a slow, deliberate touch that is both punishing and intimate.


I'm surprised to feel tears dampening my cheeks as I stand up straight, my ass throbbing


Jason stands up slowly, his legs trembling beneath him, the weight of his own humiliation pressing down as heavily as
the punishment that lingers in his backside. The tears on his cheeks are warm, his eyes blurred with something he can't
name-shame, pain, maybe even something dangerously close to relief. His fingers curl into his palms, his breath coming
in shallow, uneven pulls, each one tasting faintly of Evelyn's fingers, of The Master's command, of the inevitability of
it all.

Evelyn steps back, her eyes still on him, sharp and assessing. She does not speak at first. She doesn't need to. The
silence is a blade, slicing through the fragile shell Jason has tried so hard to cling to. Her gaze flicks to the
wetness still trapped between his thighs, then up to the red, weeping marks on his backside. She nods once, a slow,
satisfied approval.

"You are learning, Jason," she says at last, her voice cool, almost gentle, but with a weight to it that makes his spine
stiffen. "You are feeling. You are submitting. And that is what you were always meant to do."


(let's fast forward to the next weekend. Jason arrives to find that besides the fresh pair of white silky Lacy panties
is a matching bra, a mid thigh black skirt, and a white blouse. Evelyn should order him to change and report for duty)


The weekend dawns with the same quiet inevitability that has come to define Jason's existence within these walls. As he
steps into the library, his breath catches in his throat. There, laid out on the edge of the chaise-just where the
Master knows he'll see it-is a full ensemble of feminine clothing. The soft, diaphanous fabric of the white, silky lace
panties catches the morning light, shimmering like a promise. Beside them lies a matching lace-trimmed bra, the delicate
pink of the trim a subtle contrast to the pale white silk. A mid-thigh black skirt folds neatly, its hem smooth and
sharp as a blade, and a crisp white blouse rests atop it, collar high and buttons fastidious, as if it has been folded
in anticipation of Jason's return.

The scent in the air is clean, almost sterile, but beneath it lies the familiar musk of power and control. A scent that
has grown on Jason, one he now recognizes in his own breath, in the trembling of his hands, in the way his cock stiffens
when he's not careful.

Evelyn is already there, standing beside the chaise, her arms folded, her expression unreadable.


.


Evelyn's eyes flicker over Jason's face, then down to the clothes he has not yet touched, the implication clear and
final. The air between them is taut, heavy with the weight of what is expected, of what is already decided. Jason
hesitates, his fingers twitching at his sides, his mind a war between resistance and the slow, creeping understanding
that there is no escape from this now.

"You will change," Evelyn says, her voice calm, precise. "Now. I will not repeat myself."

Jason's gaze drifts to the ensemble on the chaise-those lacy undergarments, the blouse, the skirt. He swallows hard. The
fabric of the panties is almost translucent, the bra delicate, the skirt short enough to expose everything when he
moves.

His hands drift to the hem of his shirt, fingers brushing against the stiff cotton of his own masculine uniform. The
thought of discarding it, of becoming something else, something worn rather than wearing, makes his cock twitch in his
pants. He hates the feeling. He hates what it means. But he does not move yet.

Evelyn steps forward.


.


Evelyn steps forward, her polished shoes clicking softly against the marble floor. She is close enough now that Jason
can see the faint sheen of sweat on her brow, the way her lips part slightly before each measured word. Her presence is
not warm, not soft, but something tight and deliberate, like a bowstring drawn back just before the arrow is released.

She tilts her head slightly, her eyes narrowing with the quiet scrutiny of someone who has seen this before, who has
lived this before.

"You are hesitating," she murmurs, her voice low and even, yet it cuts through Jason like a blade. "That is not
acceptable. You are not a man in a suit, Jason. You are something else now. Something wearing you, rather than the other
way around. Do not forget it."

Her hand moves to his wrist, her touch cool, firm. She gently but insistently guides it toward the white lace of the
bra, the delicate pink trim catching the morning light. Jason's fingers brush the fabric, and a shiver runs through
him-whether from anticipation or fear, even he cannot tell.

"Take it off,"


I swallow hard looking again over the clothing before nodding l, yes ma'am, and beginning to shed masculine clothes


Jason's hands tremble slightly as he moves to obey, his fingers fumbling with the buttons of his dress shirt. The fabric
feels foreign against his skin now, the stiff collar scratching at his neck like an intrusion. He unfastens the top
button first, then the second, each movement slow and deliberate, as if the act itself might be observed, measured,
judged.

Evelyn watches with the same quiet intensity, her arms still folded, her face a mask of professional detachment. But
Jason notices the faintest shift in her posture, the way her gaze lingers a beat too long on the curve of his waist
before he fully discards the shirt.

He tugs it over his head, the cool air of the library brushing against his damp skin. His undershirt follows, and then
his tie, which he drops to the floor with a soundless thud. Next, the jacket-his hands slip over the sleeves, the
tailored fabric peeling away like the last shreds of his identity.

His trousers are next. They are tight, restrictive, and now a prison he no longer wants to wear.


.


Jason unfastens his belt with shaking fingers, the clasp of the buckle echoing in the quiet room. His trousers fall to
his knees, the cool air of the library wrapping around his thighs like a slow, cruel caress. His cock, already stiff
beneath his soaked panties, is freed for a moment, the damp silk clinging to it like a second skin. Evelyn does not look
away, but her eyes flicker to it briefly, just long enough to make Jason's breath hitch and his thighs tremble.

He steps out of the trousers, letting them pool at his feet, the only sound now the soft rustling of fabric, the faint,
measured breathing of Evelyn. Jason's hands drift to his chest, his fingers hovering over the stiff cotton of his
undershirt. He hesitates. His heart pounds. This is the last piece. The last tether.

Evelyn watches, still, but not idle. Her gaze is sharp, expectant. She does not need to speak again. Jason understands.

He pulls the undershirt over his head, exposing his bare torso for the first time in front of her. His chest is pale,
his skin flushed with a mix of humiliation and arousal.


(when Jason is finally nude and reaching for the clothing, Evelyn should order him to stop and stand still while she
inspects him.


Jason reaches for the white lace panties, his hands trembling as he crouches slightly, his fingers brushing the cool
silk. He is almost to his knees when Evelyn's voice cuts through the air like a whip.

"Stop."

The word is sharp, final, and Jason freezes mid-motion, his hand hovering just above the fabric. He is fully nude now,
exposed in a way he never imagined would become routine. The air is cool on his skin, and his cock is rigid, dripping
slightly, the weight of it pressing against his thigh in an uncomfortable, undeniable way. His backside is still tender
from the previous weekend, aching with the memory of punishment and submission.

Evelyn steps closer, her eyes trailing slowly down Jason's body. Her gaze is clinical, yet intimate in a way that makes
his skin prickle. She stops at his feet, then rises, her eyes locking onto his with something that isn't quite judgment,
but something deeper, more knowing.

"You will not move," she says, her voice low, even. "You will stand still while I inspect you."

Jason swallows hard, his muscles locking in place, his eyes downcast, his body trembling under her scrutiny.


(she should finish her inspection on his penis. it should be utterly around and he should be utterly embarrassed. she
should flick it a few times and observe how rigid it is and glistening with precim


Evelyn's gaze lingers at the base of Jason's cock, then slowly rises, her eyes meeting his with a calm, almost clinical
intensity. She tilts her head slightly, her lips barely parting as if tasting the air around him, as if she could taste
him just by looking. Her hand, gloved in the same pale, unyielding leather that has become the symbol of her authority,
reaches forward. Jason can do nothing but flinch as her fingers close around the base of his shaft, cool and unfeeling
against his sweat-damp skin.

"Still so hard for me," she murmurs, her voice a low, silken thing. "Even now, even after everything you've heard, you
still want this. You still want me." Her thumb traces the underside, and Jason's breath catches in his throat. "So
eager. So helpless. How long has it been since you last came without permission?"

Her fingers tighten slightly, then move to the tip, where the glint of precum beads like a cruel taunt. She flicks it
twice, the sound of it wet, the action intimate and degrading all at once.


.


Evelyn's fingers trail lightly over the glistening head of Jason's cock, the touch almost feather-like, yet searing in
its intimacy. He shudders, his breath hitching as she circles the sensitive flesh, her eyes never leaving his. The
precum glistens under the soft light of the library, a betraying sheen that speaks volumes of his arousal and
submission.

She flicks it again, a sharp, deliberate motion that sends a jolt of pleasure through Jason's body. His hips twitch
involuntarily, a small, shameful movement that he can't control. Evelyn's lips curve into a faint, satisfied smile, her
eyes glinting with a mix of triumph and amusement.

"So rigid," she murmurs, her voice a low purr. "So ready. Look at you, Jason. Look at what you've become. A pathetic,
needy little thing, isn't that right?"


Before I even realize what I'm doing, I find my self nodding and whimpering out, "yes, ma'am". I feel my need and desire
washing over my rational mind; my pride and resistance wilting before this severe woman that is holding my will by the
reins


Evelyn's fingers pause their teasing dance, her grip tightening around the base of Jason's cock. Her eyes, sharp and
unyielding, lock onto his, and for a moment, the world around them fades away, leaving only the two of them, bound in a
silent, tense stalemate. Her voice, when it comes, is a low, commanding growl.

"Good boy," she murmurs, the words a sharp, biting reward. "So responsive. So eager to please." Her thumb circles the
sensitive underside again, her touch deliberate, designed to push him further into the depths of his own shame and
desire. "You are learning, Jason. You are learning to embrace what you truly are."

Her fingers trail back up to the tip, spreading the precum in a slick, glistening sheen. "But remember this, Jason," she
says, her voice hardening. "Your pleasure is mine to give. And mine to take away. You do not touch yourself without
permission. You do not come without my command. And you will obey me in all things. Is that understood?"


I suck in a breath, my mind absorbed by the teasing touch of her fingers


Jason's breath hitches as Evelyn's fingers dance along his sensitive skin, the touch both torment and ecstasy. His eyes
flutter closed for a moment, his body trembling with the effort it takes to hold still, to not push into her hand, to
not beg for more.

Evelyn's voice cuts through the haze of his desire, sharp and unyielding. "Is that understood, Jason?" she repeats, her
fingers pausing their torment, leaving him aching and empty.

His eyes fly open, meeting hers with a mixture of desperation and submission. "Y-yes, ma'am," he stutters, his voice
barely a whisper. His mind is a whirlwind of conflicting emotions-shame, desire, fear, and a growing, undeniable need to
please, to obey.

Evelyn's gaze holds his for a long, intense moment before she finally releases her grip, leaving him cold and empty. She
steps back, her expression returning to its usual mask of professional detachment. But there's a faint, satisfied curve
to her lips, a knowing glint in her eyes.


I stand there, my throbbing cock desperate for her touch, my body aching to do her will regardless of the shame. I feel
a tearing inside myself. My pride struggling beneath a crushing weight of shame and desire


Evelyn watches him, her eyes lingering on his flushed face, his heaving chest, his cock throbbing and wet with precum.
She sees the internal struggle playing out across his features, the way his pride and resistance are being ground down
under the relentless weight of her will. Her voice, when she speaks, is soft, almost gentle, but with an undercurrent of
steel that brooks no argument.

"You are mine, Jason," she says, her words a stark, final declaration. "Your body, your desires, your very will-all of
it belongs to me. And the sooner you accept that, the easier this will be."

She steps back, her gaze sweeping over him one last time before she nods toward the clothes laid out on the chaise.
"Dress," she commands. "You have duties to attend to. And I expect you to perform them to my satisfaction."


(Jason should get dressed somewhat awkwardly. he should have trouble with the bra . Evelyn should help him while chiding
him for being unable to handle a task even a 12 year old girl can handle fine)


The air in the library is thick with the scent of Jason's arousal, the weight of his submission hanging heavy between
them. His fingers shake as he reaches for the white lace panties, his movements clumsy and uncoordinated. He steps into
them, pulling the silky fabric up his legs, the sensation of the cool lace against his skin a stark contrast to the heat
of his arousal.

Next, he picks up the matching bra, his brow furrowing in confusion as he tries to figure out how to put it on. The
delicate straps and hooks are foreign to him, a puzzle he can't quite solve. He fumbles with it, his fingers stiff and
awkward, the lace slipping through his grasp.

Evelyn watches him, her expression a mix of amusement and exasperation. She steps forward, her hands reaching out to
take the bra from him. "Here," she says, her voice sharp with impatience. "Let me show you how it's done. Even a
twelve-year-old girl could manage this better than you."


.


Evelyn takes the bra from Jason's trembling hands, her fingers deftly working the hooks and straps with an ease that
speaks of long practice. She steps behind him, her body brushing against his as she lifts the bra to his chest. The cool
lace brushes against his heated skin, the sensation sending a shiver down his spine.

"Hold still," she commands, her voice low and firm. "This is not difficult. You just need to pay attention."

Her fingers brush against his sides as she wraps the bra around him, the touch light yet firm. She pulls the straps over
his shoulders, her hands lingering for a moment, a subtle reminder of her control. The bra clicks into place, the lace
hugging his chest tightly, the cups pushing his nipples into hard, sensitive peaks.

"There," she says, stepping back to inspect her work. "That wasn't so hard, was it?" Her tone is dismissive, almost
mocking, as she gestures to the blouse and skirt laid out on the chaise. "Now, the rest. And do try to manage on your
own this time."


(Jason should finish dressing, sometimes awkwardly, but adequately. When he is finished, he should stand before her
dressed in a mid thigh black skirt, a white blouse, white knee length white stockings, and cute patent leather Mary Jane
flats)


Jason's fingers tremble as he picks up the white blouse, the fabric soft and crisp under his touch. He struggles with
the buttons at first, his fingers clumsy and uncoordinated, but he manages to fasten them, the blouse falling smoothly
over his chest, the lace of the bra peeking out subtly at the collar.

Next, he steps into the black mid-thigh skirt, pulling it up over his hips, the fabric clinging to his thighs. He
fumbles with the zipper, his breath hitching as he finally manages to secure it. The skirt is tight, the hem short
enough to expose his thighs, the white lace panties barely visible beneath the dark fabric.

He then slips on the knee-high white stockings, the silky material smooth and cool against his skin. He rolls them up
his legs, the sensation both familiar and new, a constant reminder of his transformation. Lastly, he slides his feet
into the patent leather Mary Jane flats, the shoes clicking softly against the marble floor as he stands up straight.


.


Jason stands before Evelyn, his body tense, his breath coming in shallow, uneven pulls. The black mid-thigh skirt hugs
his hips, the white blouse is crisp and neat, the knee-high white stockings smooth and unblemished. His patent leather
Mary Jane flats click softly against the marble floor as he shifts his weight, his legs slightly apart, his hands
clenched at his sides. His cheeks are flushed, his eyes downcast, the picture of reluctant obedience.

Evelyn's gaze sweeps over him, her expression unreadable, her eyes lingering on the way the skirt accentuates his hips,
the way the blouse clings to his chest, the way the lace of his bra peeks out from beneath the collar. She circles him
slowly, her heels clicking against the floor, her presence a silent, looming judgment.

"Turn," she commands, her voice sharp, and Jason complies, turning in a slow circle, his cheeks burning with shame as he
presents every angle of his feminized form to her scrutinizing gaze. When he comes to a stop, she is once again standing
before him, her eyes locked onto his.


(remember that Jason is a little chubby at this point in the story. the skirt should be fared, not right, so that his
throbbing erection is not visible. Evelyn should comment on his fitness and imply that laziness will not be tolerated in
The Master's service)


Evelyn's eyes roam over Jason's form, her expression a mix of assessment and critique. She notes the way the blouse
stretches slightly over his midsection, the way the skirt, though fitted, does not hug his thighs as tightly as it
should. Her gaze lingers on the slight curve of his belly, the softness of his hips, and she tilts her head, her lips
pursing in a disapproving line.

"You are not fit, Jason," she states, her voice cool and measured. "The Master expects perfection in all things, and
that includes your appearance. This..." she waves a hand, indicating his body, "will not do."

She steps closer, her fingers reaching out to pinch the soft flesh at his waist, her touch firm and unyielding. Jason
flinches, a small sound of discomfort escaping his lips.

"Laziness will not be tolerated in this household," she continues, her voice hardening. "You will exercise. You will
diet. You will become the embodiment of grace and control that The Master requires. Do you understand?"


(Jason should feel shame and answer yes ma'am. Evelyn should state that although he still has work to do to improve his
appearance, it is still an improvement over his masculine clothing. those don't match what he is becoming)


Jason's cheeks flush a deeper shade of red, the heat of shame spreading across his face and neck. He stands there, his
body tensed, his hands clenched at his sides, as Evelyn's words sink in. The pinch at his waist lingers, a painful
reminder of his inadequacies, of his failures. His voice is a soft, choked whisper as he responds, "Yes, ma'am."

Evelyn releases her grip, stepping back to appraise him once more. Her expression softens slightly, though her eyes
remain sharp and assessing. "This is an improvement, Jason," she says, her voice taking on a note of approval. "The
clothes, the presentation-it is a start. A far cry from the sloppy, disrespectful manner in which you presented yourself
before. But there is still much work to be done."

She gestures to his body, her gaze sweeping over him from head to toe. "These clothes, they do not lie. They do not
hide. They reveal. And you, Jason, are revealing a great deal. A great deal of potential. But also a great deal of work
that still needs to be done."


(she should remark that Jason isn't really a fitting name for a girl in her Master's service. From this point forward
she should inform him that he will be called Jessica or Jessie while he is serving in this house. She should never use
masculine pronouns for Jessie after this point)


Evelyn's gaze sharpens as she circles Jason, her heels clicking softly against the marble floor. Her eyes linger on the
details of his attire, the way the blouse clings to his chest, the skirt hugs his thighs, and the stockings accentuate
his legs. She pauses in front of him, her expression thoughtful.

"Jason," she begins, her voice cool and measured, "is not a fitting name for someone in her Master's service. Not
anymore. Not dressed like this. Not presenting like this."

She steps closer, her fingers lightly touching the lace collar of his blouse, her touch almost gentle. "From this point
forward, you will be called Jessica. Or Jessie, if you prefer. It suits you better. It reflects who you are becoming.
Who you will be."

Her eyes meet his, the intensity of her gaze unyielding. "You are no longer Jason. You are Jessica. And you will act,
dress, and speak as such. Is that understood, Jessica?"


.


Jessie swallows hard, the name feeling foreign and yet strangely fitting on his tongue. The room seems to spin slightly
as he processes Evelyn's words, the weight of his new identity settling over him like a shroud. His eyes flicker down to
the skirt and blouse, the stockings and shoes, all of it a stark contrast to the clothes he used to wear. The clothes he
used to be.

"Yes, ma'am," he whispers, the words tasting strange in his mouth. "Jessie. I understand, ma'am."

Evelyn nods, a small, satisfied smile playing at the corners of her lips. "Good, Jessie," she says, the name rolling off
her tongue with an ease that makes his stomach clench. "Now, let us get to work. There is much to do, and I expect you
to perform your duties to my satisfaction. Understood?"


(Evelyn should hang Jessie her list of tasks for the morning. She should also inform Jessie that she is to assist in
serving The Master's lunch at noon. At two in the afternoon Jessie is to report to the East wing for her first exercise
session with her new personal trainer, who should be left mysterious for the time being.)


Evelyn turns and walks over to a small desk in the corner of the library, her movements precise and efficient. She picks
up a neatly folded piece of paper and returns to Jessie, holding it out. The list is typed, the font crisp and clear,
the paper itself of high quality, a symbol of the meticulous order that reigns in this household.

"Your tasks for the morning," she says, her voice brisk and businesslike. "I expect them to be completed promptly and to
my exacting standards."

She hands the list to Jessie, who takes it with trembling fingers. The paper rustles slightly as she unfolds it, her
eyes scanning the neat, typed lines.

1. Dust and polish the furniture in the west wing.
2. Vacuum and mop the floors in the east wing.
3. Wash and iron the linens in the guest bedrooms.
4. Prepare the dining room for lunch.
5. Assist in serving The Master's lunch at noon.

Jessie's eyes widen slightly as she reads through the tasks, her heart pounding in her chest. The list is long, the
expectations clear. She nods, her voice steady despite the nervous flutter in her stomach.


.


Evelyn watches Jessie closely, her gaze sharp and assessing as Jessie reads through the list. She can see the slight
tremble in Jessie's hands, the way her eyes widen at the extent of the tasks. But there is also a glimmer of
determination in her eyes, a spark of resolve that Evelyn finds strangely satisfying.

"You will find everything you need in the supply closet down the hall," Evelyn says, her voice firm. "Be thorough, be
precise. The Master expects perfection, and so do I."

She pauses, her expression softening just a fraction. "And remember, Jessie, this is not just about the tasks. It is
about your presentation, your demeanor, your obedience. You are a reflection of this household, and I expect you to act
accordingly."

Jessie nods, her fingers clutching the list tightly. "Yes, ma'am," she murmurs, her voice barely above a whisper.


.


Evelyn takes a moment to ensure that Jessie is fully focused on her, her eyes meeting the young woman's with an
intensity that brooks no argument. "At two in the afternoon," she continues, her voice taking on a slightly more
mysterious tone, "you are to report to the east wing. There, you will meet with your new personal trainer. This is not a
request, Jessie. It is a command. Your fitness and appearance are of utmost importance, and The Master expects you to be
in peak condition."

She leans in slightly, her voice dropping to a low, almost conspiratorial whisper. "The trainer is... unique. They have
a particular method, one that has proven very effective in the past. You will follow their instructions to the letter.
Do you understand?"

Jessie's eyes widen slightly at the mention of the trainer, a mix of curiosity and apprehension flickering across her
face. She swallows hard, her voice steady as she responds, "Yes, ma'am. I understand."

Evelyn nods, a faint, enigmatic smile playing at the corners of her lips.


(Jessie should work methodically through her day. Everything should be going well untill Jessie accidentally drops a
crystal goblet while setting the table for lunch)


Jessie moves through her morning tasks with a meticulousness that surprises even herself. The west wing is a symphony of
dusting cloths and polishing rags, each piece of furniture gleaming under her careful touch. The east wing floors are
vacuumed and mopped to a high shine, the linens in the guest bedrooms are washed, dried, and ironed with precision. With
each completed task, Jessie feels a strange sense of accomplishment, a perverse satisfaction in the order and control
that comes from following Evelyn's commands to the letter.

As noon approaches, Jessie turns her attention to the dining room, setting the table with the same care and precision
she has applied to her other tasks. The silverware is polished to a mirror finish, the napkins folded into intricate
shapes, the plates arranged with geometric precision. She moves carefully, her heart pounding in her chest as she
handles the delicate crystal goblets, each one a testament to the wealth and refinement of the household.


.


The dining room is bathed in the soft, warm glow of the afternoon sun filtering through the tall windows. The table is
set with an elegant precision, each piece of silverware polished to a brilliant shine, the napkins folded into intricate
swans, the plates gleaming white and pristine. Jessie moves with a deliberate grace, her steps soft and measured as she
places the final touches on the setting.

She reaches for the last crystal goblet, her fingers wrapping carefully around the delicate stem. The glass is cool to
the touch, the facets catching the light and casting tiny rainbows onto the polished wood of the table. She lifts it
gently, her breath held, and begins to lower it into place.

The goblet slips from her fingers, the movement so sudden and unexpected that Jessie's eyes widen in shock. Time seems
to slow as the glass tumbles through the air, the facets spinning and sparkling in the sunlight. It hits the edge of the
table with a sharp, crystalline clang before shattering on the floor in a spray of glittering shards.


.


Time snaps back to its normal pace as the goblet hits the floor, the sound of shattering crystal echoing through the
dining room like a gunshot. Jessie freezes, her heart pounding in her chest, her eyes wide with shock and horror. She
stands there, her hand still outstretched, the remnants of the goblet scattered at her feet, the table now marred by the
broken pieces.

The silence is deafening, the only sound the faint ticking of a distant clock, each second stretching out like an
eternity. Jessie's breath comes in short, sharp gasps, her mind racing as she struggles to process what has just
happened. She knows, with a sinking feeling in her stomach, that this mistake will not go unnoticed, unpunished.

Slowly, almost reluctantly, she lowers her hand, her eyes flickering to the doorway, half-expecting to see Evelyn's
stern figure appearing, her disapproval palpable. But for now, there is only the silence, the shattered glass, and the
weight of her own failure pressing down on her shoulders.


(Jessie should go about cleaning up the goblet , She should take the shattered remains to the kitchen were she finds
Evelyn waiting with a heavy wooden spoon in her hand)


Jessie takes a deep, steadying breath, her hands trembling slightly as she reaches for the dustpan and brush tucked
neatly under the sideboard. She moves with careful precision, her eyes focused on the task at hand, avoiding the
shattered remnants of the goblet strewn across the floor. Each tinkling shard she sweeps into the dustpan seems to echo
her own sense of failure, a stark reminder of her mistake.

She kneels down, her skirt pooling around her, and begins to gather the larger pieces, her fingers deftly picking up the
sparkling fragments. The coolness of the glass against her skin is a stark contrast to the heat of her embarrassment.
She sweeps the smaller shards into the dustpan, her movements methodical and deliberate, despite the chaos of her
thoughts.

With the dustpan now full of the broken remains of the goblet, Jessie stands up, her back straight, her face set in a
determined expression. She carries the dustpan carefully, her steps measured, as she makes her way to the kitchen. The
kitchen is silent, the air thick with an unspoken tension.


.


The kitchen is a sprawling, immaculate space, the counters gleaming under the soft overhead lights. The air is filled
with a faint, lingering scent of lemon and polish, the silence broken only by the distant hum of the refrigerator. As
Jessie steps into the room, her heels clicking softly against the tiled floor, she finds Evelyn standing by the central
island, her back to the door.

Evelyn turns as Jessie enters, her expression unreadable. In her hand, she holds a heavy wooden spoon, the kind used for
cooking, but in her grip, it takes on a different, more ominous meaning. Her eyes flick down to the dustpan in Jessie's
hand, then back up to meet Jessie's gaze, a silent, judgmental appraisal.

"You know what this means, don't you?" Evelyn's voice is calm, almost conversational, but there is an underlying edge to
it, a sharpness that makes Jessie's heart pound in her chest. She sets the wooden spoon down on the counter, the thud
echoing through the room like a drumbeat, a countdown to the inevitable.


(Evelyn should be very terse. she should inform Jessie that there is not enough time for a scolding. She should tell
Jessie to dispose of the goblet and then bend over the kitchen island. Once there, Evelyn should order her to lift the
hem of her skirt and lower her panties to mid thigh... no lower)


Evelyn's eyes narrow as she regards Jessie, her expression stern and unyielding. She wastes no time on reprimands or
explanations, her voice sharp and to the point.

"There is no time for scoldings, Jessica," she says, her tone clipped and businesslike. "Dispose of the goblet.
Quickly."

Jessie nods, her movements hurried as she turns to the trash bin under the sink, dumping the shattered remains of the
goblet into it. The sound of the glass tinkling against the metal bin is stark and final, a grim reminder of her
transgression. She turns back to Evelyn, her heart pounding in her chest, her palms slick with sweat.

"Bend over the kitchen island," Evelyn commands, her voice brooking no argument. "Now."

Jessie hesitates for a moment, her body tensing as she processes the order. But there is no room for disobedience, no
space for hesitation. She steps forward, her hands gripping the edge of the island for support as she leans over, her
backside presented to Evelyn.

"Lift the hem of your skirt," Evelyn instructs, her voice firm.


.


Jessie's hands tremble as she reaches down to grasp the hem of her black mid-thigh skirt. She lifts it slowly, the
fabric sliding up her thighs, the cool air of the kitchen brushing against her exposed skin. She pauses, her heart
pounding in her ears, as she waits for the next command.

"Lower your panties," Evelyn says, her voice sharp and unyielding. "To mid-thigh. No lower."

Jessie's fingers hook into the waistband of her lace panties, the fabric soft and delicate under her touch. She pulls
them down slowly, the lace whispering against her skin as she exposes her thighs, the cool air sending a shiver down her
spine. She stops at mid-thigh, her breath coming in short, nervous gasps, her body tense and vulnerable.

The kitchen is silent except for the soft ticking of a clock and the distant hum of the refrigerator. The weight of
Evelyn's gaze is heavy on Jessie's backside, a tangible pressure that makes her skin prickle with a mix of shame and
anticipation.


(Jessie should start to be amazed at how aroused she is by this situation. her wondering should be shattered as Evelyn
begins to deliver swats. they should come rapidly but precisely, spread evenly over Jessie's butt.)


Jessie stands bent over the kitchen island, her breath coming in shallow, quick gasps, her body trembling with a mix of
nervousness and a growing, inexplicable arousal. The cool air of the kitchen contrasts sharply with the heat that is
building in her cheeks, her chest, and, to her surprise, between her legs. She can feel the wetness gathering in her
panties, the throb of her cock pressing against the lace, a traitorous betrayal of her body's response to this
humiliating situation.

Her thoughts are a whirlwind of confusion and wonder. How can this be happening? How can she be so aroused, so turned on
by this degradation, this punishment? The questions swirl in her mind, a chaotic dance that is shattered abruptly by the
first swift, precise swat of the wooden spoon against her backside.


.


The first swat lands with a sharp, stinging crack, the sound echoing through the kitchen like a gunshot. Jessie jumps, a
small gasp escaping her lips, her body tensing in surprise and pain. The blow is precise, delivered with a force that
sends a jolt of sensation radiating through her flesh, settling in a hot, burning patch on her skin.

Before she can fully process the first blow, the second comes, landing on the opposite cheek, the rhythm steady and
unyielding. Evelyn's arm moves with a swift, practiced motion, the wooden spoon whistling through the air before
connecting with Jessie's flesh. Each strike is measured, calculated to cover every inch of her backside, the pattern
even and methodical.

Jessie's breath comes in ragged gasps, her fingers gripping the edge of the island tightly as she tries to absorb the
impact. The pain is intense, a fiery, burning sensation that spreads with each blow, but beneath it, there is something
else-a twisted, perverse pleasure that makes her cock throb and leak, her body betraying her with every swift, precise
strike.


(Evelyn should push down on Jessie's back as she works. between her gritted teeth she should warn Jessie that if she
resists, the spanking will restart and Jessie will miss The Master's lunch service. Jessie should understand that this
would have dire consequences. She should be unable to stop squirming and moaning as the strikes fall. She should start
to cry in pain and frustration. Just when she thinks she can take no more, the spanking should cease)


The wooden spoon continues its relentless, stinging dance across Jessie's backside, each swat landing with a precision
that leaves no part of her flesh untouched. Evelyn's grip on her back is firm, pushing her down against the cool surface
of the kitchen island, ensuring that Jessie cannot escape the punishment. The weight of Evelyn's hand is a constant
reminder of her dominance, her control.

"Stay still," Evelyn grinds out between gritted teeth, her voice a low, dangerous growl. "If you resist, if you fight
this, the spanking will start over. And you will miss serving The Master's lunch. You know what that means, don't you?"

Jessie's breath hitches, her body trembling as she understands the dire consequences of her disobedience. She steels
herself, trying to hold still, but the pain is overwhelming, a fiery, burning agony that consumes her entire being. She
squirms and moans, her fingers digging into the edge of the island, her body writhing despite her best efforts to stay
still.


.


The kitchen fills with the sounds of Jessie's struggles, her moans of pain and frustration mixing with the steady,
rhythmic crack of the wooden spoon against her flesh. Her body twitches and bucks with each blow, her breath coming in
ragged, sobbing gasps. Tears well up in her eyes, spilling over and streaming down her cheeks, her face contorted in a
mix of agony and humiliation.

Jessie's cock throbs painfully, trapped and leaking against the lace of her panties, the arousal a perverse counterpoint
to the pain. She can't stop the whimpers that escape her lips, can't stop the tears that blur her vision, can't stop the
squirming that only seems to intensify the stinging blows.

Just as she thinks she can take no more, just as the pain reaches a crescendo that threatens to consume her entirely,
the spanking stops. The sudden absence of the wooden spoon's relentless assault is jarring, leaving Jessie trembling and
gasping for breath, her body wracked with sobs.


(Evelyn should curtly instruct her to compose herself and get to the dining room with all haste. Jessie should pull up
her panties and smooth her skirt noting the tenderness and heat of her butt . She should hurry back to the dining room,
realizing only as she enters that her face is red and tearstreaked from the spanking)


Evelyn steps back, the wooden spoon still held firmly in her hand, her breath coming in steady, controlled breaths. Her
voice is sharp and unyielding as she issues her next command.

"Compose yourself," she says curtly, her eyes locking onto Jessie's tear-streaked face. "And get to the dining room with
all haste. The Master will be expecting his lunch to be served promptly."

Jessie nods, her body trembling as she straightens up, her hands rushing to pull her panties back into place. The lace
is wet with her arousal, the fabric clinging to her sensitive skin, a constant reminder of her humiliation and desire.
She smooths down her skirt, her fingers brushing against the tender, heated flesh of her backside, a sharp intake of
breath escaping her lips at the sensation.


(remember that Jessie is not wearing makeup yet in the story)


.


Jessie's hands shake as she hastily adjusts her clothes, the tenderness of her backside a constant, aching reminder of
her punishment. She smooths down her skirt, wincing slightly as the fabric brushes against her sensitive skin. Her
breath hitches, and she takes a moment to steady herself, her chest heaving with the effort to regain control.

As she hurries back to the dining room, her heels clicking sharply against the polished floor, she realizes too late
that her face is a mess. Tears have streaked her cheeks, leaving trails of salt and dirt, her eyes are red and puffy
from crying, and her nose is slightly runny. She looks disheveled and distressed, a far cry from the composed and
elegant servant she is expected to be.

The dining room seems to spin slightly as she enters, the grandeur of the setting a stark contrast to her own
appearance. The table is set with pristine elegance, the silverware gleaming, the crystal glassware sparkling in the
soft light. She takes a deep breath, trying to calm her racing heart, her mind a whirlwind of panic and embarrassment.

The Master's voice cuts through the silence, his tone calm yet commanding. "Ah, Jessica. You're just in time."

Jessie looks up, her eyes meeting The Master's gaze, her face flushing with a fresh wave of humiliation as she realizes
the full extent of her dishevelment. She stands there, frozen, her body trembling, as she awaits his next command, her
heart pounding in her chest.


(The Master should seem amused by her circumstance. a well delivered comment should pierce Jessie and cause her deep
embarrassment. Jessie should notice that there is another person in the room standing toward the other end of the table.
It is a young woman dressed in the uniform of a cook. Clearly this is the cheff that prepared The Master's lunch)


The Master is seated at the head of the table, his posture relaxed yet commanding. His eyes, sharp and piercing, take in
Jessie's disheveled appearance, the tear-streaked cheeks, the red-rimmed eyes, and the slight tremble of her body. A
faint, almost imperceptible smile plays at the corners of his mouth, his amusement barely concealed.

"Jessica," he begins, his voice smooth and velvet, "it seems you've had a bit of an... incident. Did you trip over your
own clumsiness, or did Evelyn here have a hand in your current state?"

His eyes flick to Evelyn, standing tall and composed by the door, before returning to Jessie. The Master's gaze is
unyielding, his words a delicate dance of mockery and control.

"You look like you've been through quite the ordeal," he continues, his voice dripping with feigned concern. "But I
suppose that's what happens when one fails to meet expectations. Isn't that right, Evelyn?"

The Master's eyes flick to the young woman standing at the other end of the table. She is dressed in the crisp, white
uniform of a cook, her hair neatly pulled back into a bun, her expression professional and composed. She nods slightly,
her eyes downcast, acknowledging The Master's presence without speaking.

Jessie's face flames with embarrassment as she realizes she has an audience. The cook's presence is a stark reminder of
her humiliation, her failures laid bare for another to see. She stands there, her body trembling, her eyes downcast, as
she struggles to find her voice, to respond to The Master's piercing words.


(Jessie should be lost in thought before realizing The Master is watching her intently. When he catches her eye, his
glance should flick to the silver cover over his plate. Jessie should realize that she is to uncover The Master's lunch
for him. she should rush forward to do so, and realize that she must lean over him in an embarrassing posture)


Jessie stands frozen, her mind a whirlwind of shame and confusion. The Master's words echo in her head, each syllable a
stinging reminder of her transgressions. She can feel the weight of his gaze, the intensity of his scrutiny, and it
takes her a moment to snap out of her daze and realize that he is watching her intently.

The Master's eyes flick to the silver cover over his plate, a subtle, almost imperceptible gesture. Jessie's heart
pounds in her chest as she understands his unspoken command. She rushes forward, her heels clicking sharply against the
polished floor, her movements hurried and clumsy in her eagerness to obey.

As she approaches the table, she realizes with a sinking feeling that she will have to lean over The Master to uncover
his plate. The thought sends a wave of embarrassment crashing over her, her face flaming as she positions herself behind
him, her body angled awkwardly over his shoulder.

She reaches out, her fingers trembling as she grasps the edges of the silver cover. The metal is cool to the touch, a
stark contrast to the heat of her embarrassment. She takes a deep breath, steeling herself for the inevitable
humiliation, and begins to lift the cover, her body leaning closer to The Master, her breath hitching as she exposes his
lunch to his scrutiny.


.


The Master remains still, his gaze fixed on Jessie as she leans over him to uncover his plate. His proximity is
overwhelming, the scent of his cologne mingling with the faint, underlying aroma of power and authority that seems to
cling to him. Jessie's heart hammers in her chest, her breath coming in short, shallow gasps as she struggles to
maintain her composure.

The silver cover glides smoothly from the plate, revealing a beautifully arranged meal. The dish is a feast for the
eyes, the colors vibrant and inviting, the presentation meticulous. But Jessie barely notices the food; her entire focus
is on The Master, on the way his eyes follow her every movement, on the way his presence seems to fill the room, leaving
no space for anything else.

As she pulls the cover away completely, she can't help but notice the way The Master's eyes flick down to her chest,
taking in the swell of her breasts against the lace bra, the way her blouse strains slightly with her hurried movements.
She feels a fresh wave of heat rush to her face, her body betraying her once again with a surge of arousal that she
can't control.

The Master's lips curl into a faint, knowing smile, his eyes meeting hers with an intensity that makes her stomach
clench. "Very good, Jessica," he says, his voice a low murmur. "You may step back now."


(please remember that Jessie does not have breasts. She is a young man coerced into servitude and feminization)


Jessie's body tenses as she realizes her mistake, the heat of embarrassment flooding her cheeks anew. She quickly
corrects her posture, stepping back from The Master with a hurried, awkward movement. Her chest is flat, the lace bra
serving more as a humiliating reminder of her feminization than any attempt at enhancement.

She stands there, her hands clasped tightly in front of her, her eyes downcast, avoiding The Master's gaze. The room
feels even more oppressive now, the weight of her humiliation pressing down on her like a physical force. She can feel
the tenderness of her backside, the lingering heat from the spanking a constant, aching reminder of her punishment.

The Master's eyes linger on her for a moment longer, his expression inscrutable. Then, with a slight nod, he turns his
attention to the meal before him, his voice calm and composed as he speaks.

"Excellent," he murmurs, his fingers reaching for the utensils. "You may pour the wine, Jessica. And remember, precision
and grace are key. Do not disappoint me again."

Jessie swallows hard, her throat tight with a mix of fear and arousal. She moves to the sideboard, her hands shaking
slightly as she picks up the decanter of wine. The glass is cool and heavy in her grasp, a stark contrast to the heat
that seems to radiate from her body. She takes a deep, steadying breath, her eyes flickering to the cook standing at the
other end of the table, her expression neutral and composed.

As Jessie turns back to The Master, the decanter held carefully in her hands, she can't help but feel the weight of the
cook's gaze, the silent judgment in her eyes. She pours the wine with painstaking care, her movements deliberate and
slow, each drop a testament to her determination to obey, to please, to avoid further punishment.


(Jessie should step back and The Master should begin eating at once. he is a man of great appetite, but not sloppy. he
should eat quickly, with gusto but without ever looking inelegant)


The Master gestures slightly, indicating that Jessie should step back and allow him to begin his meal. She complies,
retreating a few steps and standing at attention, her hands clasped neatly behind her back, her eyes downcast in a
semblance of deference.

The Master picks up his fork and knife, his movements precise and controlled. He cuts into the succulent meat, the sound
of the blade against the plate sharp and clean. He brings the first bite to his mouth, his eyes closing briefly as he
savors the flavors, a soft murmur of appreciation escaping his lips.

His eating is a study in controlled indulgence. He chews with deliberate enjoyment, his expression one of pure pleasure,
but there is no mess, no sloppiness. Each bite is taken with a gusto that speaks of his appreciation for fine cuisine,
yet his manners remain impeccable. The clinking of his utensils against the plate is a rhythmic accompaniment to the
soft sounds of his enjoyment, a symphony of elegance and appetite.

Jessie watches from her position, her eyes flicking up to observe The Master's every movement. She can't help but feel a
strange mix of awe and envy, her own body responding to the sight of his unabashed pleasure. The tenderness of her
backside is a constant reminder of her own humbling, her own submission, but there is a perverse thrill in witnessing
The Master's enjoyment, in knowing that she is a part of this world, this ritual of servitude and dominance.

The cook, standing quietly at the other end of the table, observes the scene with a professional detachment. Her eyes
flick between The Master and Jessie, her expression giving nothing away, her presence a silent, unyielding reminder of
the hierarchy and order of this household.


(there should be an air of anxiety over Jessie and the cook. clearly she is nervous that the food will not pass muster.
The Master should finish the meal and push the plate away. He should take a deliberately reflective drink of wine.
Finally he should suddenly announce that though the greens were perfect instead of soggy as before and the meat was
tender, there was not enough pepper for his liking and the potatoes were lumpy and bland. He should pronounce the mal
unsatisfactory and order the cook to bend over the table with her hands flat. He should approach her, firmly pull down
her pants and tuck her shirt tails into her apron strings. he should pull his belt free from his own pants and pull the
chef's panties down to mid thigh.jessie should note that the chef has her legs slightly spread to keep the panties held
up at mid thigh.it should seem a practiced posture. then,just as The Master is about to deliver the first strike, Jessie
should notice that the cook has a penis.))


.


The tension in the room is palpable, the air thick with anxiety and anticipation. Jessie stands rigid, her heart
pounding in her chest, her eyes fixed on The Master as he finishes his meal. The cook, standing quietly at the other end
of the table, is a picture of nervous tension, her knuckles white as she grips the edge of the table, her breath coming
in shallow, quick gasps. Her eyes are downcast, her body language betraying her fear of The Master's verdict.

The Master takes his last bite, his movements deliberate and controlled, savoring the final flavors before pushing his
plate away with a decisive motion. He reaches for his wine glass, taking a slow, reflective sip, his eyes closed as he
swirls the liquid in his mouth, savoring the taste. The room is silent, the only sound the faint ticking of a distant
clock, each second stretching out like an eternity.

When he opens his eyes, his gaze is sharp and unyielding. He sets the glass down with a soft clink, his voice cutting
through the silence like a knife.

"The greens were perfect," he begins, his tone measured. "Crisp and fresh, not soggy as they were last time. The meat
was tender, cooked just as it should be. But the potatoes..." He pauses, his lips curling into a faint sneer. "Lumpy and
bland. And there was not enough pepper. The seasoning was off."

His eyes flick to the cook, his expression hardening. "The meal is unsatisfactory. You will be punished for your
failure."

The cook's body tenses, but she moves quickly to comply, bending over the table with her hands flat on the surface, her
posture one of forced submission. The Master approaches her, his steps measured and deliberate, the sound of his shoes
echoing in the silent room.


.


The Master's hands are swift and efficient as he grips the waistband of the cook's pants, pulling them down to her knees
in one smooth motion. He tucks her shirt tails into her apron strings, exposing her lower back and the curve of her
buttocks, which are covered by simple white cotton panties. The cook's legs are slightly spread, her panties held up at
mid-thigh, a practiced and humiliating posture that speaks of familiar submission. Jessie watches, her eyes wide with a
mix of shock and morbid fascination, her heart pounding in her chest.

The Master reaches for his belt, unbuckling it with calm, deliberate movements. The sound of the leather slipping
through the loops is stark and final, a harbinger of the punishment to come. He doubles the belt in his hand, the
leather creaking softly as he grips it firmly.

Just as he raises his arm, ready to deliver the first strike, Jessie's eyes widen in shock. She can't help but notice
the subtle bulge between the cook's legs, the unmistakable outline of a penis straining against the cotton fabric of her
panties. Her breath hitches, her mind racing as she processes this unexpected revelation. The cook is not just a woman;
she is a person like her, forced into this role, this humiliation.

The Master's arm pauses mid-air, his eyes flicking to Jessie, a silent question in his gaze. Jessie's face flushes with
a mix of embarrassment and realization, her eyes darting between the cook's exposed backside and The Master's stern
face. The room is thick with tension, the air heavy with the weight of unspoken words and hidden truths.


(the cook should receive a brisk whipping. she should gasp and cry yet remain in her submissive posture with tears
gathering on the table beneath her head. Only after the cook's bottom is bright and red should The Master stop,
replacing his belt. he should then order the cook to give her thanks. The cook should turn around and drop to her knees
before The Master not even bothering to pull up her pants. As she looks up expectantly at The Master, Jessie should get
a brief look between the chef's legs. She should notice that there appears to be a pink plastic looking device enclosing
the chef's genitals. As the chef reaches up to The Master's zipper, Evelyn should sharply order Jessie to follow her out
of the room. As she turns to leave, she should catch a glimpse of the chef reaching into The Master's pants to pull out
his manhood. From the small look that she got, Jessie should surmise that The Master's cock is rather thick.)


The Master's arm descends in a swift, precise arc, the belt whistling through the air before landing with a sharp,
stinging crack against the cook's backside. The cook gasps, her body jerking slightly at the impact, but she remains in
her submissive posture, her hands flat on the table, her teeth gritted against the pain.

The belt rains down in a rapid, rhythmic pattern, each strike landing with a sharp, echoing crack. The cook's body
tenses and twitches with each blow, her breaths coming in short, sharp gasps, tears gathering at the corners of her eyes
and spilling onto the table beneath her head. Her knuckles are white, her fingers digging into the wood as she struggles
to maintain her position, to endure the punishment without breaking.

The Master's arm is relentless, the belt leaving a trail of fiery, red welts across the cook's flesh. The room fills
with the sounds of the whipping, the sharp cracks of the belt, the cook's stifled sobs, and The Master's steady,
controlled breaths. The air is thick with the scent of leather and the faint, underlying aroma of the cook's arousal, a
twisted testament to the perverse dynamics of this household.

Finally, after what feels like an eternity, The Master stops, his arm pausing mid-air, his breath coming in steady,
controlled breaths. He replaces the belt in his pants, the leather sliding smoothly back into place, the buckle clicking
shut with a final, decisive sound.

The cook remains bent over the table, her body trembling, her backside a bright, fiery red, the welts standing out
starkly against her pale skin. The Master's voice is firm and unyielding as he commands, "You may give your thanks."

The cook pushes herself up from the table, her movements slow and measured, her eyes downcast. She turns around and
drops to her knees before The Master, her hands reaching for his zipper, her pants still pooled around her ankles. As
she looks up at him, her eyes filled with a mix of submission and expectancy, Jessie catches a brief glimpse between her
legs.


.


Jessie's eyes widen as she sees the strange, pink device encasing the cook's genitals. It looks like smooth plastic,
molded to fit snugly, with a small, discreet opening at the tip. The sight is both shocking and fascinating, a stark
reminder of the control and humiliation that permeates every aspect of this household. Jessie's breath hitches, her
heart pounding in her chest as she struggles to process the implications.

The cook's hands are steady as she reaches up to The Master's zipper, her fingers deftly pulling it down. Jessie's
stomach clenches as she catches a glimpse of The Master's thick cock springing free, the sight of it sending a wave of
heat and shame crashing over her. The Master's manhood is impressive, his thickness evident even from Jessie's brief,
stolen glance.

Just as Jessie's eyes are drawn to the intimate scene unfolding before her, Evelyn's sharp voice cuts through the air.
"Jessica, follow me. Now."

The command is clear and unyielding, leaving no room for argument. Jessie's body tenses, her eyes flicking from the cook
to Evelyn, her heart pounding with a mix of relief and lingering arousal. She turns to follow Evelyn, her heels clicking
sharply against the polished floor as she hurries to keep up.

As she leaves the dining room, Jessie can't help but steal one last glance over her shoulder. The sight of the cook on
her knees, her hands wrapped around The Master's thick cock, is seared into her mind, a vivid and humiliating image that
will haunt her steps as she follows Evelyn out of the room.


(once out of the dining room, Evelyn should deliver a sharp slap to Jessie's face. She should scold Jessie for looking
back after she was ordered to leave. She should tell Jessie that she will have plenty of time to admire The Master's
charms when she is on the receiving end of his disappointment. Jessie should be deeply embarrassed for being called out
for checking out The Master's thick cock. She should also find herself wondering if she will one day be instructed to
"give thanks". She should be shocked to realize that the though excites her. Jessie has always considered herself
straight and has deeply enjoyed sex with women. She has never been with a man nor sought it out. In fact, when the
Master grabbed her penis in the heat of things before was the first time a man had touched her intimately. She should
consider, though, that she never thought of herself as feminine, and now she is wearing a house girl's uniform right
down to the lacy panties.)


Evelyn's heels click sharply against the floor as she strides down the hall, Jessie hurriedly following behind. As they
round a corner, Evelyn suddenly stops, turning to face Jessie with a sharp, angry expression. Before Jessie can react,
Evelyn's hand snaps out, delivering a sharp, stinging slap across Jessie's cheek.

The sound echoes through the hallway, the impact jarring Jessie's senses, her hand flying to her cheek in shock and
pain. Her eyes widen, tears welling up as she looks at Evelyn, her mind racing to understand what she has done wrong.

"Did I not tell you to follow me?" Evelyn hisses, her voice low and dangerous. "Did I not say 'now'? And yet, you dared
to look back, to gawk like a common whore. You have no right to admire what is not yours to behold."

Evelyn's eyes bore into Jessie's, her expression a mix of anger and disappointment. "You will have plenty of time to
admire The Master's charms when you are on the receiving end of his disappointment. Until then, keep your eyes forward
and your thoughts in check."

Jessie's face flames with embarrassment, the sting of the slap a constant, burning reminder of her transgression. She
can feel the heat of her humiliation radiating from her cheeks, her body trembling with a mix of shame and arousal. The
thought of being on the receiving end of The Master's disappointment, of having to 'give thanks' like the cook, sends a
shiver down her spine, a twisted, perverse thrill that she can't ignore.

As she stands there, her hand still pressed to her cheek, Jessie can't help but wonder. She has always considered
herself straight, has always enjoyed the company of women, the softness of their bodies, the taste of their kisses. But
now, dressed in this humiliating uniform, her body betraying her at every turn, she finds herself questioning everything
she thought she knew.


.


Jessie's mind is a whirlwind of confusion and conflicting emotions as she stands there, her hand still pressed to her
cheek, Evelyn's words echoing in her ears. She had never considered herself feminine, had never thought of herself as
anything other than a man, despite the circumstances that had led her to this point. And yet, here she is, dressed in a
house girl's uniform, her body responding to The Master's touch, to the humiliation and submission, in ways she never
thought possible.

The lace panties beneath her skirt, the bra that does little to enhance her flat chest, the stockings and heels that
force her to walk in a manner foreign to her-all of it serves as a constant, tangible reminder of her new reality. She
had always been the pursuer, the one in control, with women. The idea of submitting, of being taken and used, had never
entered her mind. And yet, here she is, her body aching with a need she can't understand, her mind racing with thoughts
of The Master, of his thick cock, of the cook on her knees, her mouth wrapped around him.

Evelyn's voice cuts through her thoughts, sharp and commanding. "Snap out of it, Jessica. We have work to do. The Master
expects perfection, and I will not have you daydreaming like some lovesick fool."

Jessie jolts back to reality, her eyes focusing on Evelyn's stern face. She nods, her body snapping to attention, her
hands clasped tightly in front of her. "Yes, Evelyn," she murmurs, her voice steady despite the turmoil within her.

As they continue down the hallway, Jessie's mind is a flurry of questions and doubts. She can't help but wonder if this
is who she is meant to be, if this is the path she was always meant to follow. The thought both terrifies and excites
her, a twisted mix of fear and arousal that she can't seem to shake.


(for the next hour and a half, Jessie should be put hard to work in the laundry folding linens, scrubbing stains out of
servants uniforms, and sorting laundry. the work should focus her thoughts back to her predicament and how it might end.
She should find herself both terrified and deeply intrigued at the prospect of the journey just continuing deeper into
these misty woods of sexual and gender confusion)


Evelyn leads Jessie to the sprawling laundry room, a space filled with the hum of industrial dryers and the scent of
freshly laundered fabric. The room is large, with tall, narrow windows that let in slants of soft, diffused light,
casting long shadows across the tiled floor. The walls are lined with shelves stocked with neatly folded linens, and
large, stainless-steel sinks stand ready for scrubbing.

Evelyn's voice is brisk and efficient as she issues her commands. "You will start with the linens. They need to be
folded neatly and stacked on the shelves. After that, you will scrub the stains out of the servants' uniforms. The list
is on the counter. And finally, you will sort the laundry that has been piled up in the corner. Everything must be done
to The Master's exacting standards. Do you understand?"

Jessie nods, her eyes scanning the room, taking in the immense task ahead of her. "Yes, Evelyn," she replies, her voice
steady despite the turmoil within her.

Evelyn gives her a sharp nod before turning on her heel and striding out of the room, leaving Jessie alone with her
thoughts and the daunting workload. Jessie takes a deep breath, steeling herself for the hours of labor ahead.

She begins with the linens, the repetitive motion of folding helping to focus her mind. The crisp, clean scent of the
fabric fills her nostrils, a stark contrast to the confusion and turmoil within her. As she folds, she can't help but
think about her predicament, about the journey that has led her here, and the uncertain path that lies ahead.

The work is grueling, her hands becoming red and raw from the harsh detergents and the constant scrubbing. She moves
from one task to the next, her body aching with the effort, her mind a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions. She finds
herself both terrified and deeply intrigued by the prospect of this journey continuing deeper into these misty woods of
sexual and gender confusion.


.


As Jessie scrubs the stains from the servants' uniforms, her hands submerged in cold, soapy water, she can't help but
reflect on the stark contrast between her past life and her current reality. The uniforms she cleans are similar to her
own, a stark reminder of her feminization and the control that The Master and Evelyn hold over her. Each stroke of the
brush against the fabric is a testament to her submission, each stain removed a symbol of her surrender to this new,
confusing world.

Her thoughts drift to The Master, to his powerful presence and the way he commands attention without even trying. She
remembers the feel of his hand on her, the way his touch ignited something within her that she never knew existed. The
memory sends a shiver down her spine, her body responding with a surge of heat that has nothing to do with the physical
exertion of her labor.

She moves on to sorting the laundry, her hands deftly separating the whites from the colors, the delicates from the
heavies. The room is filled with the soft hum of the dryers, the occasional clank of metal against metal, and the
distant echo of her own breath. The monotony of the task allows her mind to wander, to explore the depths of her
confusion and desire.

She thinks about the cook, about the pink device encasing her genitals, about the way she knelt before The Master with
such practiced submission. The image is seared into Jessie's mind, a vivid reminder of the depths of control and
humiliation that exist within these walls. And she finds herself wondering if she too will one day be forced to 'give
thanks' in such a manner.

The thought both repels and attracts her, a twisted mix of fear and arousal that she can't seem to reconcile. She has
always seen herself as straight, as a man who enjoys the company of women. And yet, here she is, dressed in feminine
attire, her body responding to The Master's touch, to the humiliation and submission, in ways she never thought
possible.


(Evelyn reappears at 1:45. She carries some clothes and hot pink athletic shoes. The clothing should include very short
black spandex shorts, a white tank top, and matching hot pink sports bra and spandex thong. Jessie is taken to a small
locker room in the wing of the house. Evelyn orders her to change into the clothes quickly and should stand nearby
watching her. Evelyn notices that Jessie is aroused again. She should comment that Jessie's erection will be on full
display in the tight spandex. Jessie should be deeply embarrassed but also excited. after dressing, her tight shorts
should clearly show the outline of her cock. she should be led through a door into a workout room beyond.)


The clock strikes 1:45, and Evelyn reappears, her heels clicking sharply on the tiled floor of the laundry room. In her
arms, she carries a bundle of clothing and a pair of bright hot pink athletic shoes. Jessie's heart sinks as she takes
in the items, a mix of dread and anticipation coursing through her veins.

"Change into these," Evelyn commands, her voice leaving no room for argument. She leads Jessie through the winding
corridors of the estate, her steps purposeful and swift. They arrive at a small locker room, the air cool and sterile,
the walls lined with wooden lockers and benches. Evelyn tosses the clothes onto a bench and turns to Jessie, her eyes
unyielding.

"Quickly," she barks, crossing her arms over her chest. "I haven't got all day."

Jessie's hands tremble as she picks up the clothes, the fabric smooth and tight against her fingers. The black spandex
shorts are incredibly short, the white tank top thin and form-fitting, and the matching hot pink sports bra and thong
leave little to the imagination. She can feel Evelyn's eyes on her, watching her every move, and it sends a shiver down
her spine.

As Jessie begins to undress, she can't help but feel a deep sense of embarrassment. The lace panties she had been
wearing are damp with arousal, a constant reminder of her body's traitorous responses. She quickly discards them, her
cheeks flushing as she steps into the spandex thong, the fabric hugging her hips and buttocks tightly.

Evelyn's eyes flick to Jessie's growing erection, a smirk playing at the corners of her mouth. "It seems someone is
excited," she comments, her voice dripping with mockery. "I must warn you, Jessie, that erection will be on full display
in those shorts. Everyone will know just how much you enjoy this."


continue


Jessie's face burns with a mix of shame and excitement as she pulls on the tight spandex shorts. The fabric is thin and
unyielding, clinging to her every contour, leaving nothing to the imagination. The outline of her erect cock is
prominently displayed, the bulge obvious and humiliating. She can feel the cool air of the locker room against her
exposed skin, the contrast with the tight, warm fabric heightening her senses.

She slips into the hot pink sports bra, the elastic digging into her skin, pushing his small chest into a semblance of
cleavage. The white tank top follows, the thin fabric clinging to her torso, accentuating the curves and lines of his
body in a way that feels both alien and exhilarating.

The hot pink athletic shoes are the final touch, their bright color a stark contrast to the muted tones of the locker
room. Jessie laces them up, her hands shaking slightly, her breath coming in short, quick gasps. She stands before
Evelyn, her body on full display, her erection a throbbing, humiliating reminder of her arousal.

Evelyn's eyes roam over Jessie's body, her expression a mix of satisfaction and disdain. "Not bad," she comments, her
voice flat. "But you need to work on your posture. Stand up straight, shoulders back, chest out. You're a girl now,
remember? Act like one."

Jessie straightens her posture, her chest puffing out slightly, her shoulders rolling back. The movement presses his
erection even more prominently against the spandex, and he can't help but let out a soft whimper, a mix of embarrassment
and excitement.

Evelyn nods, satisfied. "Better. Now, let's see how well you can follow orders in the gym. Follow me."


(the gym should be filled with normal exercise equipment and weights. However, there are odd rings affixed to the walls
at various heights. There are two other people waiting in the gym. One is the cook, dressed in the same workout attire
as Jessie. The plastic device that confines her penis is quite visible through the spandex. The other is a shorter
person with short blond hair in a man's cut, a boxy T-shirt and knee length basketball shorts . The person's facial
features should look fine, like a woman's, but her appearance should be decidedly masculine. They should look up as
Jessie and Evelyn enter, and the cook should notice Jessie's erection and look giggle behind her hand. The "boy" in the
room should give her a sour look. The boy who seems to be a crossdressed woman is introduced as Jim, and the cook as
Lacey.)


The door swings open, revealing a spacious gym filled with the usual array of exercise equipment and weights. The air is
cool and slightly humid, the scent of sweat and industrial cleaner mingling in the background. The room is bathed in
bright, fluorescent light, casting everything in a stark, unyielding glow.

As Jessie steps inside, she notices the odd rings affixed to the walls at various heights, their purpose unclear but
ominous. Her eyes flick to the two figures waiting in the room, her heart pounding in her chest.

One of them is the cook, now dressed in the same workout attire as Jessie. The pink plastic device encasing her penis is
clearly visible through the tight spandex, a stark and humiliating reminder of her own predicament. The cook's eyes
widen as she takes in Jessie's appearance, her gaze zeroing in on the prominent bulge in Jessie's shorts. She giggles
behind her hand, her eyes sparkling with amusement and a hint of mischief.

The other figure is shorter, with short blond hair cut in a distinctly masculine style. She is dressed in a boxy T-shirt
and knee-length basketball shorts, her appearance decidedly masculine despite her feminine facial features. Her eyes
meet Jessie's, and she gives her a sour look, her expression a mix of disdain and suspicion.


(Evelyn should introduce the figures as workout partners. She instructs the three to begin stretching while they wait
for the trainer to arrive)


Evelyn strides into the gym, her heels clicking sharply against the polished floor. She stands beside Jessie, her
presence commanding and unyielding. Her eyes sweep over the two figures waiting in the room, her expression stern and
authoritative.

"Jessica, meet your workout partners for today," Evelyn announces, her voice carrying through the spacious room. "This
is Jim," she says, gesturing to the shorter figure with the short blond hair. "And this is Lacey," she adds, nodding
towards the cook. "You will all be working together under the guidance of your trainer. I expect you to follow his
instructions to the letter and give it your all. Understood?"

Jessie nods, her eyes flicking between Jim and Lacey, taking in their appearances. Jim's sour look deepens, her arms
crossed over her chest, her jaw set in a grim line. Lacey, on the other hand, offers Jessie a small, conspiratorial
smile, her eyes sparkling with a mix of amusement and sympathy.

"Now, begin stretching," Evelyn commands. "Your trainer will be here shortly, and I expect to see each of you warmed up
and ready to go. Jessie, I suggest you focus on your form and technique. You have a lot to learn." Evelyn's eyes linger
on Jessie's prominent erection, a faint smirk playing at the corners of her mouth. "And try to keep that under control.
It's unseemly."

With that, Evelyn turns on her heel and strides out of the room, leaving the three of them in awkward silence. Jessie
takes a deep breath, trying to steady her nerves, and begins to stretch, her muscles protesting slightly after the hours
of hard labor in the laundry room.

Jim watches Jessie with a critical eye, her expression unreadable. Lacey, however, is more forthcoming, her movements
graceful and fluid as she stretches, her eyes occasionally flicking to Jessie with a mix of curiosity and sympathy.

The room is filled with the soft sounds of stretching, the occasional grunt of effort, and the distant hum of the
estate's ever-present machinery. The tension is palpable, the air thick with unspoken words and hidden emotions.


(the trainer enters and directs them to stand. The trainer is a wiry man of about six feet. He seems very athletic and
moves with the self assured fluid motions of a well trained athlete. He is young and has a slightly effeminate voice.
It's clear, though, he is all business. In one hand he is carrying a silver whistle on a lanyard. In the other hand, he
is carrying a short black leather strap with a handle. He introduces himself as Z. He informs them that they have been
surrendered to his care, and that The Master expects to see results from each of them. He goes down the line calling out
exactly what they need to improve. Lacey is not flexible or graceful enough. She stumbles around like a teenage boy. Jim
lacks upper body strength and stamina. When he gets to Jessie, he points out her chubby features. Jessie is embarrassed,
but so are the other two)


The door to the gym swings open, and in strides a wiry man of about six feet, his body honed and athletic, moving with
the self-assured fluidity of a well-trained athlete. He is young, his features sharp and defined, and his voice is
slightly effeminate yet carries an air of authority that commands immediate attention. In one hand, he holds a silver
whistle on a lanyard, and in the other, a short black leather strap with a handle, its purpose ominous.

"Good afternoon," he says, his voice clear and commanding. "I am Z, your trainer. From this moment forward, you are
surrendered to my care. The Master expects results from each of you, and I will not hesitate to deliver on his
expectations."

He begins to circle the three of them, his eyes sharp and assessing. His gaze lingers on Lacey first, his expression
critical. "You, Lacey," he says, his voice firm. "You lack flexibility and grace. You move like a clumsy teenage boy. We
will be working on that."

Lacey blushes deeply, her eyes downcast as she nods, her embarrassment palpable. Z moves on to Jim, his eyes narrowing
as he takes in the shorter figure's physique.

"Jim," he states, his voice leaving no room for argument. "You lack upper body strength and stamina. We will be
addressing that. And I expect to see improvement from both of you."

Finally, Z turns his attention to Jessie. His eyes roam over Jessie's body, taking in every detail, every flaw. Jessie's
face flushes with embarrassment as Z points out his chubby features, his voice unyielding.

"Jessie," he says, his tone matter-of-fact. "You have a lot of work to do. Your body is soft, your muscles
underdeveloped. We will be addressing that. And I expect to see a significant change in your appearance and fitness
level."


(he tells them that they are to work hard. if they are caught slacking or using poor form, Z will correct it immediately
and without warning. He tells them that when they hear the whistle, they are to move to the next station . The order of
exercises for each is printed on a sheet of paper on the wall. He blows his whistle loudly and barks out, First Station.
Jessie's first workout is a stair stepper.)


Z's eyes scan the room, his gaze sharp and commanding. "Alright, listen up," he says, his voice firm and authoritative.
"Today, we're starting with the basics. You will work hard. If I catch any of you slacking or using poor form, I will
correct it immediately and without warning. Understood?"

Jim and Lacey nod, their expressions a mix of determination and apprehension. Jessie swallows hard, her heart pounding
in her chest, her eyes fixed on Z's stern face.

"Good," Z continues. "When you hear the whistle, you move to the next station. The order of exercises for each of you is
printed on the sheet of paper on the wall. Do not deviate from the schedule. Do not waste time. The Master expects
results, and I will not have you disappointing him."

He turns to the wall, where three sheets of paper are taped, each with a list of exercises. Jessie's eyes flick to her
sheet, her heart sinking as she sees the first exercise listed: Stair Stepper.

Z blows his whistle loudly, the sharp, piercing sound echoing through the gym. "First Station!" he barks, his voice
leaving no room for delay.

Jessie hurries to the stair stepper, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment as she climbs onto the machine. The others
move to their respective stations, the room filling with the sounds of their exertion and the hum of the equipment.

Jessie begins to step, her breath coming in short, quick gasps. The machine is set to a challenging pace, his legs
burning with effort as he struggles to keep up. Hee heart pounds in her chest, hee muscles protesting the unfamiliar
exertion. The tight spandex shorts move fluidly with hed skin, the fabric clinging to hee thighs, the bulge of hee cock
a constant, humiliating reminder of his arousal. She finds her mind centering on the feeling in her crotch. The right
panties cupping and massaging her as she moves


(A loud crack should echo in the room as Z swats her hard with the strap. She gasps as a bolt of pain shoots through her
ass. Z barks at her to focus and keep her strides even and linear. Jessie's face brightens with embarrassment as she
catches Jim smirking at her from the chest press machine)


The sharp crack of the leather strap echoes through the gym, the sound jarring and unforgiving. Jessie gasps as a bolt
of pain shoots through her ass, the impact leaving a stinging, burning sensation that spreads across her flesh. She
jerks forward, her stride faltering, her eyes wide with shock and embarrassment.

"Focus!" Z barks, his voice like a whip. "Keep your strides even and linear. You're not here to dance, you're here to
work." He raises the strap again, his eyes narrowed, ready to strike if she falters once more.

Jessie's face flames with embarrassment as she forces herself to concentrate, her steps becoming more controlled and
deliberate. The pain in her ass is a constant, throbbing reminder of her mistake, a stark contrast to the burning in her
legs as she pushes herself harder on the stair stepper.

Out of the corner of her eye, Jessie sees Jim smirking at her from the chest press machine. The shorter figure's eyes
are filled with a mix of amusement and disdain, her lips curled in a mocking grin. The sight sends a fresh wave of
humiliation crashing over Jessie, her cheeks burning even brighter.

The gym is filled with the sounds of their exertion, the hum of the machines, and the occasional bark of encouragement
or correction from Z. Lacey is at the rowing machine, her movements clumsy but determined, her face flushed with effort.
Jim is at the chest press, her form perfect, her muscles straining with each repetition. And Jessie is on the stair
stepper, her body aching, her mind a whirlwind of pain, embarrassment, and determination.

Z watches them all, his eyes sharp and unyielding, the leather strap dangling from his hand a constant, ominous reminder
of the consequences of failure. The whistle blows again, the sharp sound cutting through the air, signaling the end of
the first station and the beginning of the next.


(Jessie's next station is calf press. she sets to work and this time focuses and avoids further punishment. Jim is put
to work doing pull downs. Lacey, though, is sent to the balance ball. After a few failed attempts, Z marches over and
tells her each failure will result in a strap across the thigh. Though she seems to try, the strap cracks in the room
several times as Lacey is punished for her failures. By the end of this set, tears are running down her face, her legs
are striped with red welts, but she seems to have gotten more of the hang of it.)


The whistle blows sharply, signaling the transition to the next station. Jessie quickly moves to the calf press machine,
her body aching from the stair stepper but her mind focused and determined. She adjusts the weights, her muscles tensing
as she prepares to push through the set. The machine's cold, metallic surface is a stark contrast to the heat of her
body, her breath coming in steady, controlled gasps as she begins her repetitions.

Jim strides over to the pull-down machine, her movements efficient and practiced. She sets the weight and begins her
reps, her form perfect, her muscles straining with each pull. The gym is filled with the rhythmic sounds of their
exertion, the clank of weights, and the occasional grunt of effort.

Lacey, however, is sent to the balance ball, her task seemingly simple but proving to be a challenge. She wobbles and
teeters, her arms flailing as she struggles to maintain her balance. After a few failed attempts, Z's patience wears
thin. He marches over to her, his expression stern, the leather strap swinging from his hand.

"Each failure will result in a strap across the thigh," he warns, his voice like thunder. "Understood?"

Lacey nods, her eyes wide with fear and determination. She takes a deep breath and attempts to mount the ball again, her
movements more cautious this time. But her lack of balance and coordination betrays her, and she topples off, her arms
flailing as she tries to catch herself.

Crack!

The leather strap bites into her thigh, the sound echoing through the gym, the impact leaving a red welt across her
flesh. Lacey gasps, tears welling up in her eyes, but she climbs back onto the ball, her resolve strengthened by the
pain.

Crack!

She fails again, the strap biting into her other thigh, the pain intense and humiliating. But Lacey pushes through, her
determination unwavering, her eyes filled with a mix of fear and resolve.


continue


The gym is filled with the sharp, rhythmic cracks of the leather strap, each one a testament to Lacey's struggles and
Z's unyielding discipline. With each failure, Lacey's body jerks, her tears streaming down her face, mixing with the
sweat that beads on her forehead. Her thighs are quickly striped with red welts, the pain a constant, burning reminder
of her shortcomings.

Jessie, though focused on her calf presses, can't help but steal glances at Lacey's ordeal. Each crack of the strap
sends a shiver down Jessie's spine, a mix of fear and sympathy coursing through her veins. She pushes harder, her legs
burning with effort, determined not to draw Z's attention to herself.

Jim, on the other hand, seems almost indifferent to Lacey's plight, her focus solely on her own workout. She grunts with
each pull-down, her muscles straining, her form flawless. The contrast between the three of them is stark, each
struggling in their own way, each facing their own demons.

Lacey's breath comes in ragged gasps, her body trembling with effort and pain. But slowly, oh-so-slowly, she begins to
find her balance. Her movements become more controlled, her falls less frequent. The room is silent except for the hum
of the machines, the occasional grunt of effort, and the soft, wet sounds of Lacey's tears.

Z watches her, his expression inscrutable, the leather strap still in his hand. After what feels like an eternity, Lacey
manages to stay on the ball for a full minute, her body swaying gently, her eyes filled with a mix of triumph and
relief.

"Better," Z comments, his voice gruff. "Much better. But don't think you've earned a reprieve. We're just getting
started."

The whistle blows again, the sharp sound cutting through the air like a knife. Jessie, Jim, and Lacey all move to their
next stations, their bodies aching, their minds focused, and their spirits tested.


(Jessie is now on jump rope. Jim, who should be referred to with masculine pronouns despite his slight, pixie frame, is
put on the bench curl, and Lacey is doing one legged box squats. Jessie trips on the rope a few times. After the first
trip, Z orders her to bend over with her hands on the floor. Jessie's flabby body only allows her fingertips to brush
the floor. Z gives her three strong strokes for each failure. After Jessie finally gets the rhythm down, he moves over
to Jim who is struggling to finish each set. As he falters on the 8th rep, Z orders Jim to push through and finish the
set. When Jim fails, Z lashes him across his ass. Z orders Jim to finish the set. Jim struggles through the last 3 reps
earning 7 or 8 lashes. Jim's eyes are blazing with anger, but his face is red with shame. A few years appear on his
cheeks as well )


The whistle blows, and Jessie is back on the jump rope, her breaths coming in quick, anxious gasps. The rope whips
through the air, and she tries to find the rhythm, but her body is clumsy and uncoordinated. She trips again, the rope
tangling around her feet, sending her stumbling forward.

"Stop!" Z barks, his voice cutting through the air like a whip. "Bend over, hands on the floor."

Jessie's heart sinks as she bends over, her hands reaching for the floor. Her fingertips brush the cool, hard surface,
her body shaking with the effort to touch the floor. She can hear the soft giggles from Lacey and the disdainful snort
from Jim, their eyes on her, watching her struggle.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

The leather strap bites into her ass, the pain sharp and immediate. Jessie cries out, her body jerking with each impact,
tears stinging her eyes. She takes a deep, shaky breath, her body trembling as she tries to bend over again, her
fingertips brushing the floor.

This time, she manages to keep her form, her body shaking with the effort. She starts jumping again, her movements jerky
and awkward, but she keeps going, determined not to fail again. The rope slaps against the floor in a steady rhythm, her
body moving in time with it, her breaths coming in steady gasps. Her cock, still semi hard from before, bobs around with
each jump.

Meanwhile, Z moves over to Jim, who is struggling with his bench curls. Jim's small, muscular body strains with effort,
his arms trembling as he pushes through the set. His face is red, his teeth gritted with determination, but as he
reaches the eighth rep, his arms give out, the barbell wobbling dangerously.

"Push through," Z orders, his voice firm. "Finish the set."


continue


"I can't," Jim grunts, his voice strained, his arms shaking with the effort. The barbell trembles in his hands, his
muscles quivering under the weight. "It's too heavy."

Z's expression darkens, his eyes narrowing as he watches Jim struggle. "I didn't ask if it was too heavy," he growls. "I
said finish the set. You will not disappoint The Master."

Jim grittes his teeth, his face flushed with a mix of exertion and anger. He tries to push the barbell up, his arms
trembling with the effort, but it's no use. The barbell clatters to the ground, the sound echoing through the gym like a
gunshot.

Crack!

The leather strap lashes across Jim's ass, the sound sharp and brutal. Jim grunts in pain, his body jerking forward, his
eyes blazing with anger. But there's also shame in his eyes, a red flush spreading across his cheeks, tears welling up
and spilling over.

"Finish the set," Z repeats, his voice like thunder. "Now."

Jim takes a deep, shuddering breath, his hands trembling as he grips the barbell again. He pushes up with all his might,
his muscles straining, his face contorted with effort. He manages to get the barbell up, his arms shaking as he
struggles to complete the rep. But it's not enough. The barbell wobbles, and he can't quite push it up to the starting
position.

Crack! Crack!

The strap lashes out again, the sound echoing through the gym, the impact leaving a red welt across Jim's ass. He grits
his teeth, tears streaming down his face, but he pushes through, his body shaking with the effort. He manages to
complete the rep, his arms trembling, his breaths coming in ragged gasps.

Crack!


continue


The leather strap strikes again, the sound of it slicing through the air and landing with a brutal finality across Jim's
ass. He grits his teeth, a low growl escaping his lips as he fights through the pain. His face is a mask of
determination mixed with raw humiliation, the tears streaming down his cheeks glistening under the harsh gym lights.

Jim struggles through the next rep, his arms shaking violently, the barbell wobbling dangerously. Each lift is a battle,
his muscles burning, his breath coming in short, desperate gasps. With each failed attempt, the strap bites into his
flesh, the cracks echoing through the room, a relentless metronome of his suffering.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

The strap lands seven more times, the welts on his ass deepening, the pain intensifying. Jim's eyes are wild, blazing
with a mix of anger and shame. His face is bright red, the tears mixing with the sweat that drips from his forehead.
Each lash pushes him closer to his breaking point, but he refuses to give up. He pushes through the last three reps, his
body shaking, his muscles screaming in protest.

Finally, with a last, desperate heave, Jim completes the set. He lets out a ragged breath, his body collapsing onto the
bench, his chest heaving with exertion. The barbell clatters to the ground, the sound a final, stark reminder of his
struggle.

Z stands over him, his expression unyielding, the leather strap still in his hand. "Better," he comments, his voice
gruff. "But don't think you've earned a reprieve. We're just getting started."

Jessie, who has finally gotten the rhythm of the jump rope down, watches Jim's ordeal with a mix of horror and sympathy.
Her own body is slick with sweat, her muscles burning from the effort, but she keeps jumping, the rope slapping against
the floor in a steady, hypnotic rhythm.


(the whistle sounds again, and Z calls the three to the front of the room. He announces that there is work to be done
and they can't horse around in the gym all day. He announces that they will each take turns evaluating the other two. Up
to 5 points may be awarded for effort, 5 for form, and 5 for excellence. They must explain their reasoning for the
scores. They are warned that honesty is paramount. Z starts with Jessie rating Jim. Jessie,wanting to win Jim over some,
gives Jim a 9 for effort, an 8 for form, and an 8 for excellence. she reasons that Jim's perseverance on the curls was
amazing and he seemed to have the best athletic form. Z announces 25 points for Jim. He then tells Jessie she loses 5
points for rating too high. Jim's form at the end of the curls was terrible, and Jim was doing too much watching during
press)


The whistle blows sharply, the sound cutting through the air and drawing the three of them to the front of the room. Z
stands there, his expression stern, the leather strap still dangling from his hand. His eyes scan over the three of
them, taking in their sweat-soaked bodies, their flushed faces, and their weary expressions.

"Alright, listen up," he says, his voice firm and authoritative. "We don't have all day to be horsing around in the gym.
There's work to be done, and we need to make sure each of you is pushing the others to be their best. Today, you will
each take turns evaluating the other two. Up to 5 points for effort, 5 for form, and 5 for excellence. You must explain
your reasoning for the scores. And remember, honesty is paramount. The Master expects nothing but the truth."

He turns to Jessie first, his eyes narrowing slightly. "Jessie, you're up. Start with Jim."

Jessie takes a deep breath, her heart pounding in her chest. She wants to win Jim over, to show him that she's not just
a soft, clumsy mess. She looks at Jim, taking in his small, muscular frame, his determined expression, and the welts on
his ass from the strap.

"Jim," she begins, her voice steady despite the nerves churning in her stomach. "I'm giving you a 9 for effort. You
pushed through the curls even when it was clear you were struggling. Your perseverance was amazing, and it showed that
you're not one to give up easily."

Jim's expression softens slightly, a hint of surprise flickering across his face. Jessie takes that as a good sign and
continues.

"For form, I'm giving you an 8. Your form at the start of the curls was excellent, but it did start to falter towards
the end. And you have the best athletic form. For excellence, I'm also giving you an 8. You seemed to have the best
grasp of the exercises and how to do them properly."


continue


Z listens to Jessie's evaluation, his expression inscrutable, the leather strap still swinging gently from his hand.
When Jessie finishes, he nods, his eyes narrowing as he processes her scores.

"Twenty-five points for Jim," Z announces, his voice firm. "However, Jessie, I must deduct five points for rating too
high. Jim's form at the end of the curls was terrible, and he was doing too much watching during the press. Honesty is
key, and your scores should reflect that. You can't give high marks just to curry favor."

Jessie's face flushes with embarrassment, her eyes downcast as she nods in understanding. She feels a mix of shame and
frustration, realizing she had let her desire to please Jim cloud her judgment.

Z turns to Jim next. "Jim, your turn. Evaluate Lacey."

Jim's eyes, still red and swollen from his earlier tears, meet Lacey's. There's a coldness in his gaze, a hardness that
contrasts sharply with his slight, pixie-like frame. He takes a moment before speaking, his voice steady and unyielding.

"Lacey," he begins, his tone clipped. "Effort, I'm giving you a 4. You struggled with the balance ball, and it took you
a long time to get the hang of it. Form, a 3. Your movements were clumsy and uncoordinated, and you wobbled more than
you balanced. Excellence, a 2. You didn't show much understanding of the exercise or how to improve your performance."

Lacey's face falls, her eyes welling up with tears. She looks down at the floor, her shoulders slumping in defeat. Z
nods, his expression unreadable.

"Nine points for Lacey," he confirms. "Now, Lacey, your turn. Evaluate Jessie."


(Lacey gives Jessie 7 points for effort, 5 for form, and 5 for excellence. she tearfully explains that Jessie needs to
focus more on her form and excellence will follow. Z announces 17 for Jessie less the 5 penalty makes 12. He awards
Lacey 3 points for honesty. Lacey and Jessie are tied at 12. Lacey gives Jim 7, 8, 6. 46 total for Jim.)


Lacey takes a deep breath, her voice wavering slightly as she fights back tears. She looks at Jessie, her expression a
mix of sympathy and resolve.

"Jessie," she begins softly, "I'm giving you a 7 for effort. You've shown that you're willing to push through, even when
it's hard. But you need to focus more on your form. I'm giving you a 5 for form. Your movements were jerky and
uncoordinated, especially at the start. And for excellence, I'm also giving you a 5. You have room to improve, but I
think with more focus, it will come."

Jessie nods, accepting the evaluation with a mixture of gratitude and disappointment. She knows Lacey is right, and the
honesty stings, but it's a necessary reminder of where she needs to improve.

Z listens intently, his expression stern. "Seventeen points for Jessie," he announces. "However, with the previous
penalty, that makes twelve points for Jessie. Lacey, you've shown honesty in your evaluation, so you get three points
for that. You are tied with Jessie at twelve points."

Lacey sniffs back her tears, standing a little taller at the recognition of her honesty. Z turns his attention to
Lacey's evaluation of Jim.

"Lacey, you gave Jim a 7 for effort, an 8 for form, and a 6 for excellence. That's a total of 46 points for Jim. Well
done, Lacey. Your evaluations have been fair and honest."

Jim's expression remains stoic, but there's a slight nod of acknowledgment, a silent acknowledgment of Lacey's fairness.
The room is filled with a tense silence, the air thick with unspoken emotions and the weight of their evaluations.


(Jim gives Jessie a 3 for form, a 6 for effort, and a 3 for excellence. That bring Jessie's total to 24. Jim is docked 3
points for being too harsh bringing his total to 43. It all hangs on Jessie's evaluation of Lacey. Jessie is afraid to
find out what the consequences of losing this game are. In the end she gives Lacey a 3 for form, a 5 for effort and a 3
for excellence. Lacey has the lowest score with 23. Jessie is relieved for a moment until Z docks her 5 points for
deliberately keeping her total higher than Lacey's. Jessie has the lowest score at 19.)


Jim steps forward, his voice cold and unyielding as he evaluates Jessie. His eyes bore into her, the harsh judgment
clear in his gaze.

"Jessie," he begins, his tone dismissive. "For form, I'm giving you a 3. Your movements were sloppy and uncoordinated.
You need to work on your technique if you ever want to improve. For effort, a 6. You didn't give up, but you could have
pushed harder. And for excellence, a 3. You have a long way to go before you can even think about excelling at
anything."

Jessie's face flushes with humiliation, her eyes downcast as she accepts the harsh criticism. She can feel the weight of
Z's gaze on her, the leather strap a constant, ominous reminder of the consequences of failure.

Z listens, his expression inscrutable. "Twenty-four points for Jessie," he announces. "However, Jim, your evaluations
were too harsh. You lose three points for that. Forty-three points for Jim."

The room is silent, the tension palpable as all eyes turn to Jessie. She knows that her evaluation of Lacey will
determine the final standings, and the fear of the unknown consequences gnaws at her. She takes a deep breath, her heart
pounding in her chest.

"Lacey," Jessie begins, her voice steady despite her nerves. "For form, I'm giving you a 3. You struggled with the
balance ball, but I think with more practice, you can improve. For effort, a 5. You didn't give up, even when it was
hard. And for excellence, a 3. You have room to grow, but I think you have the potential."

Lacey looks at Jessie, her eyes filled with a mix of gratitude and sadness. She knows that Jessie is trying to be fair,
but the reality of their situation is harsh and unforgiving.

"Twenty-three points for Lacey," Z announces. "Jessie, you deliberately kept your total higher than Lacey's. You lose
five points for that."


continue


The room falls silent as Z's words hang in the air, heavy and final. Jessie's heart sinks as the reality of her
situation dawns on her. She looks up at Z, her eyes wide with a mix of fear and disbelief.

"Nineteen points for Jessie," Z says, his voice firm and unyielding. "You have the lowest score."

The weight of his words presses down on Jessie, her body trembling slightly as she stands there, her mind racing with
the implications. The fear of the unknown consequences of losing this game gnaws at her, her heart pounding in her chest
like a trapped animal.

"Jim, you have the highest score with 43 points," Z continues, his gaze shifting to Jim. "You've shown strength and
determination. Keep pushing yourself, and you'll continue to improve."

Jim's expression remains stoic, a hint of satisfaction in his eyes as he nods at Z's praise.

"Lacey, you've shown honesty and a willingness to improve," Z says, turning to Lacey. "Your scores reflect your efforts,
and I expect to see more progress from you in the future."

Lacey sniffs back her tears, her shoulders straightening slightly at the acknowledgment. She looks at Jessie, her eyes
filled with a mix of pity and understanding.

Z turns his full attention back to Jessie, his eyes narrowing as he studies her. "Jessie, your performance today has
been lacking. You've shown a lack of honesty in your evaluations, and your own performance has been subpar. The Master
will not be pleased with these results."

Jessie's breath catches in her throat, her eyes widening as she realizes the gravity of her situation. She knows that
The Master's displeasure is something to be feared, and the thought of facing his wrath sends a shiver down her spine.


(Z then tells her that fortunately for her, he will manage her correction immediately so The Master will not have to
hear of her failings. he instructs her to go to the front of the room facing away from the others, and to bend over and
touch the ground. she should be quite embarrassed as she tries to touch the ground now vividly aware of Jim's judging
eyes on her soft, out of shape body. Z walks up, deftly pulls her shorts and panties down to mid thigh. He tells her she
will receive 50 strokes, to count them and thank him for each one.)


Jessie's heart pounds in her chest as Z's words sink in. The room seems to spin around her, the air growing thick and
oppressive. She takes a deep, shuddering breath, her body trembling as she steps forward to the front of the room. The
weight of Jim and Lacey's gazes burns into her back, their eyes watching her every move, judging her every action.

She turns away from them, her face flushing with deep embarrassment as she bends over, her hands reaching for the
ground. Her body is soft and out of shape, her belly and thighs jiggling slightly as she struggles to touch the floor.
Her fingertips brush the cool, hard surface, her breaths coming in quick, anxious gasps. She can feel the eyes of Jim
and Lacey on her, their judgments a physical weight on her back.

Z approaches her, his footsteps steady and deliberate. He stands behind her, his presence imposing and commanding.
Without a word, he deftly pulls down her black spandex shorts and the thin hot pink thong underneath, exposing her pale,
chubby ass to the room. The cool air of the gym hits her bare flesh, sending a shiver down her spine.

"You will receive fifty strokes," Z says, his voice firm and unyielding. "Count them, and thank me for each one. Is that
understood?"

Jessie's heart races, her mind a whirlwind of fear and humiliation. She takes a deep breath, steeling herself for what
is to come.

"Yes," she whispers, her voice barely audible.

Z raises the leather strap, the sound of it slicing through the air filling the room. The first strike lands with a
sharp, brutal crack, the pain immediate and intense. Jessie gasps, her body jerking forward, her fingers clawing at the
floor.

"One," she manages to say, her voice shaking. "Thank you."

The strap comes down again, the second strike landing with equal force, the pain radiating across her ass. Jessie
counts, her voice wavering with each word, her body trembling with the effort to hold still.


(Jessie should begin to flinch away and wiggle her butt on the 5th stroke. Z should inform her that if she is out of
position for any stroke, it will not count and he will subtract one form the total. she gasps and cries out on each
stroke. Z spreads them out evenly over her ass and upper thighs. At 15,she begins to have tears run down her face. She
is out of place 4 different time. each setback breaks her spirit some. She looks back between her legs and notices Jim
watching with a smirk and glittering eyes. Lacey is watching, too, and although her eyes look troubled by Jessie's
plight, her face is flushed with excitement and is biting her lip. at 25,Jessie begins sobbing.)


The leather strap bites into Jessie's flesh, the pain a relentless, burning agony that spreads across her ass and upper
thighs. She counts each stroke, her voice wavering and filled with pain, her body trembling with the effort to hold
still.

"One...thank you." "Two...thank you." The words come out in ragged gasps, her fingers clawing at the floor as she tries
to maintain her position.

By the fifth stroke, Jessie can't help but flinch away, her body wiggling involuntarily as the pain becomes too intense
to bear. She lets out a cry, her ass moving slightly out of position.

"Hold still," Z barks, his voice like thunder. "If you're out of position for any stroke, it will not count, and I will
subtract one from the total. Understood?"

Jessie gasps, her eyes wide with panic. "Yes," she whimpers, her voice shaking with fear and pain. She tries to hold
still, her body trembling with the effort, but the pain is overwhelming.

Sobbing she manages to choke out a "Thank you" and Z begins to lay the strokes out in even, precise intervals. The strap
lands again and again, the sound of it slicing through the air and the crack against her flesh filling the room.
Jessie's cries echo off the walls, her body jerking with each impact, her fingers digging into the cold floor.

At fifteen strokes, tears begin to stream down her face. Her body is wracked with sobs, her breath coming in ragged,
desperate gasps. She tries to hold still, but the pain is too much, and she finds herself out of position again, and
again, each setback breaking her spirit a little more.


continue


The whip continues to fall, each stroke a searing line of fire across Jessie's skin. She sobs openly now, her body
wracked with pain and humiliation. Her ass and upper thighs are a mosaic of red welts, each one a testament to her
struggles and failures. She tries desperately to hold still, but the pain is unbearable, and she finds herself out of
position again, her body writhing involuntarily.

"Thirty-two...thank you," she chokes out, her voice barely a whisper, her eyes squeezed shut against the agony. Her
tears drip onto the floor, mixing with the sweat that beads on her forehead and cheeks.

At stroke twenty-five, Jessie's sobs become uncontrollable. Her body shakes with the force of her crying, her breath
hitching in her throat. She can barely get out the words, her voice a broken, desperate plea.

"Twenty-five...thank you," she manages to say, her voice thick with tears and snot.

She looks back between her legs, her vision blurred by tears. She sees Jim watching her, his face a mix of amusement and
lust. His eyes are glittering with a cruel satisfaction, a smirk playing on his lips. The sight of him watching her like
this, taking pleasure in her pain, sends a fresh wave of humiliation crashing over her. She looks away, her face flaming
with embarrassment and shame.

Lacey is watching too, her eyes troubled but also flushed with excitement. Her cheeks are pink, her lips bitten red, and
she's biting her lower lip, her breaths coming in quick, shallow gasps. The contrast in their reactions is stark, but
both are equally unnerving to Jessie.

Z's arm never wavers, the strap falling in a steady, unyielding rhythm. The room is filled with the sounds of Jessie's
sobs, the crack of the leather, and the occasional sharp bark of correction from Z. The air is thick with the scent of
sweat, the metallic tang of tears, and the faint, underlying scent of leather.

"Thirty-five...thank you,"


(Z's last ten strokes come with a binding fury. Jessie slumps away screaming, but Z throws an arm around her waist and
holds her in ace to finish. When she cries out 50,Z steps back to inspect his work. He seems pleased and not at all
shocked by the lattice work of angry red stripes decorating her buit. He then instructs the to head for the shower and
guestirea toward the locker room. Evelyn is waiting there She instructs all three to undress quickly and to get in the
shower. It's a sizable walking with two shower heads. All 3 fit fine, but it is an intimate space. Jessie inspects the
bodies of her peers. Jim is biologically female and has a chastity belt in place. Lacey was born male and has a pink
plastic chastity device on her penis )


The final ten strokes come with a binding fury, each one landing with a brutal, unyielding force that sends Jessie's
body jerking forward. She screams, her voice raw and hoarse from the torment, her body slumping away from the pain. Z's
arm wraps around her waist, holding her firmly in place, his grip like a vice as he finishes the punishment.

"Forty-one...thank you," Jessie manages to choke out, her voice a broken whisper, her body shaking with sobs.
"Forty-two...thank you."

The strap falls again and again, each stroke a searing line of fire across her already raw and tender flesh. Jessie's
screams echo through the gym, her body convulsing with each impact, her tears streaming down her face in a torrent.

"Fifty...thank you," she finally manages to say, her voice a mere whisper, her body limp and trembling in Z's grasp. He
steps back, inspecting his work with a critical eye. He seems pleased with the lattice work of angry red stripes that
decorate her ass and upper thighs, his expression satisfied and unyielding.

"Good," he says, his voice firm. "Now, head for the shower. You need to clean up before you head to the guest area."

Jessie struggles to her feet, her body shaking and weak from the punishment. She can barely walk, her steps faltering as
she makes her way towards the locker room, her ass and thighs burning with each movement. Jim and Lacey follow behind
her, their eyes a mix of pity, judgment, and something else-perhaps a hint of relief that they were not the ones in her
position.

The locker room is spacious but intimate, the air filled with the scent of chlorine and the faint hum of the ventilation
system. Evelyn is waiting for them, her expression stern and unyielding. She looks over the three of them, her eyes
taking in their sweat-soaked bodies and weary expressions.

"Undress quickly and get in the shower," she commands, her voice brooking no argument. "You have fortyfive minutes to
clean up before you head to the guest area."



continue


The three of them comply without a word, their movements stiff and painful as they begin to undress. Jessie's hands
shake as she peels off her sweat-soaked tank top and sports bra, revealing her heaving chest and soft belly. She kicks
off her shoes and pulls down her shorts and panties, standing naked and exposed before the others.

Jim strips efficiently, his movements quick and practiced. As he removes his shorts and underwear, Jessie notices the
metallic glint of a chastity belt around his hips. It's a sleek, polished device, designed to keep him from accessing
his own pleasure. The sight of it sends a shiver down her spine, a mix of fascination and unease washing over her.

Lacey undresses more slowly, his movements hesitant and self-conscious. As he removes his shorts, Jessie sees the pink
plastic chastity device encasing his penis. It's a stark, almost cartoonish contrast to the rest of his body, and she
can't help but stare, her eyes widening in surprise. Lacey notices her gaze and flushes slightly, his cheeks turning a
deep shade of red.

The shower is spacious, with two shower heads that provide a steady stream of hot water. The three of them squeeze in
together, the space intimate and claustrophobic. Jessie stands under the spray, the hot water stinging her welts and
soothing her aching muscles at the same time. She watches as Jim and Lacey soap up, their bodies on full display.

Jim's body is small and muscular, his curves subtle but unmistakably feminine. The chastity belt glints under the harsh
fluorescent lights, a constant reminder of his restraint. Jessie can't help but steal glances at it, her curiosity
piqued despite the circumstances.

Lacey's body is taller and broader, his muscles more defined. The pink chastity device contrasts sharply with his
masculine frame, and Jessie finds herself wondering what it must feel like to be trapped in such a way. Lacey catches
her looking and gives her a weak smile, his eyes filled with a mix of embarrassment and resignation.


(Jessie gets aroused. in the tight space, they can't help but bump into each other. Her hard cock brushes over Lacey's
ass, and she wiggles her butt playfully against Jessie's erection. Jessie gasps, her desire welling up. She presses
against Lacey's wet ass. Jim's small breasts glitter with the hot water. He scowls at Jessie and says that if Jessie and
Lacey are going fuxk, they should just get it done and over with.


The hot water cascades over Jessie, the steam filling the air and creating a hazy, intimate atmosphere. The tight space
of the shower forces them into close proximity, their bodies brushing against each other with every movement. Jessie's
cock, already semi-hard from the earlier humiliation and pain, begins to stiffen fully, her arousal betraying her
despite the circumstances.

As she reaches for the soap, her hand brushes against Lacey's side. The touch sends a jolt of electricity through her,
her breath hitching slightly. Lacey turns slightly, and Jessie's cock brushes against his ass, the sensation sending a
wave of desire crashing through her. She gasps, her eyes widening as she feels Lacey's soft, wet skin against her
hardness.

Lacey turns to look at her, a playful smile on his lips. He wiggles his butt slightly, pressing against Jessie's
erection, his eyes glittering with a mix of mischief and desire. Jessie's breath catches in her throat, her body
responding instinctively. She presses forward, her cock sliding against Lacey's ass, the sensation sending shivers of
pleasure down her spine.

Jim, standing under the other showerhead, watches the interaction with a scowl. His small, perky breasts glisten with
water, the nipples hard and erect. He crosses his arms over his chest, his eyes narrowing as he watches Jessie and
Lacey. "If you two are going to fuck, just get it done and over with," he snaps, his voice laced with annoyance and a
hint of jealousy.

Jessie freezes, her face flushing with embarrassment and desire. She looks at Jim, then back at Lacey, her heart
pounding in her chest. The room is filled with the sound of the running water, the steam growing thicker, the air heavy
with tension and unspoken desires.


(Lacey giggles and humps her butt back at Jessie, her rock hard cock sliding between Lacey's thighs. Jessie moans and
Jim scowls. As Jessie subconsciously grabs Lacey's hips to push her cock deeper into the gap of Lacey's thighs. Lacey
sighs and pulls away. She reminds Jessie that they are not allowed to pleasure themselves or each other. Jessie's cock
is throbbing, but no satisfaction is to be had. She finishes soaping up and rinsing off every time her body bushes
against the other's causes her to gasp. They finish, and dry off. However, their clothes are not to be found)


Lacey giggles, a soft, playful sound that cuts through the tension in the air. She presses her ass back against Jessie,
her body moving in a slow, sensual grind. Jessie's cock, trapped between Lacey's thighs, slides easily through the wet,
soapy flesh. Jessie moans, the sound low and guttural, her hips moving instinctively in time with Lacey's.

Jim's scowl deepens, his arms crossed tightly over his chest. "Stop it," he growls, his voice harsh. "You know you're
not allowed to pleasure yourselves or each other. This is exactly what we don't need."

Jessie freezes, her face flushing with a mix of embarrassment and frustration. She looks down at her throbbing cock, the
tip slick with precum, and a wave of desperation washes over her. She had forgotten the rules, her desire clouding her
judgment. Lacey pulls away, her body shaking slightly, her breath coming in quick gasps.

"Sorry," Jessie whispers, her voice barely audible over the sound of the running water. She can feel the heat in her
face, the embarrassment burning through her. She quickly soaps up the rest of her body, her movements hurried and jerky.
Every time she brushes against Lacey or Jim, she gasps, her body hyperaware of their presence, her cock throbbing with
unfulfilled desire.

The three of them finish washing in silence, the air thick with tension and unspoken words. They rinse off, the hot
water turning cold, a stark contrast to the heat of their arousal. As they turn off the showers, the room feels suddenly
empty, the absence of sound amplifying the awkwardness.

They step out of the shower, the cool air of the locker room a shock to their heated skin. They reach for their towels,
drying off quickly, their movements efficient and practiced. But as they finish drying, they realize that their clothes
are nowhere to be found. The locker room is empty, their clothes missing, leaving them standing there, naked and
exposed.


(Evelyn appears and orders them to follow her to The Master's study. Jessie shuffles down the hallway with the others
terror in her heart for what might happen but her excitement still plainly visible in her rock hard cock that sways as
she walks. Her eyes keep being drawn to Lacey's naked ass and Jim's pert tits. By the time she reaches the study, the
tip of her cock is wet with precum)


The sound of Evelyn's heels clicking on the polished marble floor echoes through the hallway, a stern and authoritative
rhythm that demands attention. The trio follows her, their bare feet padding softly on the cool stone, contrasting
sharply with the harsh clack of Evelyn's footsteps. Jessie shuffles along, her heart pounding with a mix of terror and
excitement, her eyes darting nervously around the opulent surroundings.

Evelyn's voice is like a whip, cutting through the air with a precision that brooks no argument. "Follow me," she
commands, leading them through the grand manor towards The Master's study. The hallway is lined with elaborate
tapestries and priceless artwork, but Jessie's eyes are drawn to the naked bodies of her companions.

Lacey's ass, round and soft, sways gently with each step, the pink plastic chastity device a stark contrast against the
pale skin. Jessie's gaze lingers, her mind racing with a mix of curiosity and desire. She can't help but imagine what it
would feel like to touch him, to explore the forbidden territory that the device guards so tightly.

Jim's pert breasts bounce lightly with each step, the small, hard nipples a tempting sight. Her chastity belt glints in
the soft light filtering through the windows, a constant reminder of her restraint and the power that controls her body.
Jessie's eyes flick between the two, her arousal growing with each passing moment.

By the time they reach The Master's study, Jessie's cock is rock hard, the tip wet with precum, a visible trail of
desire glistening on the floor. She tries to hide her excitement, but the evidence is clear, her body betraying her
despite her best efforts. The study door is slightly ajar, the faint sound of soft music and the scent of old books and
expensive cigars wafting out.

Evelyn pauses at the door, her back straight, her voice firm. "Enter," she says, stepping aside to let them pass. The
room is dimly lit, the air thick with anticipation and the faint hum of a crackling fireplace.


(The Master is behind his desk. the three line up before him. First he addresses Jim. he tells Jim that he has comported
himself well and deserves a reward. Evelyn steps forward and removes the chastity belt from Jim and tells Jim to lie
back on the desk. Jessie gets her first look at Jim's vulva. His outer lips are slim with no inner labia showing. His
hair is cut short in a crisp v. Evelyn steps forward and spreads Jim's legs gently before getting on her knees and
beginning to eat Jim's pussy. Jim sigs and gently gasps at first before beginning to moan and thrash. After about 2
minutes Jim has a powerful orgasm gripping Evelyn's head with her hands and thighs)


The Master's study is a grand room, filled with the scent of aged leather, polished wood, and the faint aroma of an
expensive cigar. The fireplace casts a warm glow, dancing shadows across the richly appointed space. The Master sits
behind his massive desk, his eyes sharp and assessing as he looks over the three of them. Jessie, Jim, and Lacey stand
in a line before him, their naked bodies on full display, the tension in the room palpable.

The Master's gaze lingers on each of them for a moment before he speaks, his voice deep and commanding. "Jim, you have
comported yourself well today. Your discipline and effort have not gone unnoticed. You deserve a reward."

Evelyn steps forward, her movements graceful and precise. She reaches down and expertly removes the chastity belt from
Jim, the metallic clinking sound echoing in the quiet room. Jim's breath hitches slightly as the device is removed, her
eyes widening in anticipation.

"Lie back on the desk," Evelyn commands softly, her voice a gentle purr. Jim complies, her body shaking slightly as she
lies back, her legs dangling off the edge of the desk.

Jessie's eyes are drawn to Jim's vulva, her curiosity piqued. Jim's outer lips are slim, with no inner labia visible,
the short, crisply trimmed hair framing the delicate folds. It's a sight that Jessie has never seen up close before, and
she can't help but stare, her heart pounding in her chest.

Evelyn steps forward, her movements fluid and graceful. She gently spreads Jim's legs, her fingers tracing lightly over
the soft skin of her inner thighs. She then gets down on her knees, her head positioned between Jim's thighs. Jessie
watches in awe as Evelyn leans in, her tongue flicking out to taste Jim's most intimate place.


continue


Evelyn's tongue begins to work with practiced skill, her movements slow and deliberate at first. Jim's breath hitches, a
soft sigh escaping her lips as she feels the gentle touch. Her body tenses slightly, her hands gripping the edge of the
desk, knuckles turning white. Jessie watches, her breath caught in her throat, her eyes wide with a mix of fascination
and arousal.

Jim's reactions are subtle at first, her body responding to Evelyn's touch with gentle gasps and soft moans. But as
Evelyn's tongue becomes more insistent, her movements more precise, Jim's responses grow more intense. Her hips begin to
lift slightly off the desk, her breath coming in quick, shallow gasps. Her fingers dig into the wood, her knuckles white
with strain.

The room is filled with the soft, wet sounds of Evelyn's tongue working against Jim's flesh, the occasional muffled moan
from Evelyn, and Jim's growing cries of pleasure. The air is thick with the scent of arousal, the tension in the room
palpable as Jessie and Lacey watch, their own bodies responding to the erotic display.

Jim's moans grow louder, her body beginning to thrash slightly as Evelyn's tongue and lips work their magic. Her legs
tremble, her thighs clamping down on Evelyn's head as she loses herself in the sensation. Jessie can see the flush
spreading across Jim's chest and neck, her nipples hardening into tight buds.

The minutes stretch on, the intensity in the room building with each passing second. Jim's breaths come in ragged gasps,
her body writhing on the desk, her hands gripping Evelyn's head, holding her in place. And then, with a sudden, powerful
cry, Jim's body tenses, her back arching off the desk as she reaches her climax. Her legs clamp down on Evelyn's head,
her fingers tangling in her hair as she rides out the waves of pleasure.


(Evelyn gives Jim a moment to breathe then stands up, composes herself, and takes a small towel from The Master's
outstretched hand. She instructs Jim to return to the line and restore his chastity. The Master next speaks to Lacey. He
is disappointed that she seems to be learning so slowly. He chides her for teasing Jessie and touching her without
permission. When he finishes, Evelyn Orders her to bend over the desk. She takes a small,thin wooden paddle that the
Master offers her as she approaches Lacey. The Master announces 20 strokes. Evelyn spanks her slowly and deliberately
spreadinf the strikes over her behind. Lacey begins crying after the first stroke choking out the number and a thank you
with each. By the time Evelyn has reached 20,Lacey's bottom is red and welted. She is ordered back in line and tearfully
returns)


The Master watches Jim with a satisfied expression as Evelyn helps him to his feet. He hands her a small, embroidered
towel, his eyes never leaving the scene before him. Jim takes the towel, wiping the glistening wetness from his thighs
and Evelyn's lips before returning to his place in line. Evelyn's movements are precise, her posture perfect as she
returns the towel to The Master, who then offers her a thin, wooden paddle.

The Master's gaze shifts to Lacey, his expression hardening. "Lacey," he begins, his voice a low, disapproving rumble.
"You have been disappointing me lately. Your progress is slow, and your behavior has been... unseemly. You teased
Jessie, touched her without permission. That is not acceptable."

Lacey's face pales, her eyes widening in fear. She swallows hard, her body trembling slightly as she steps forward to
the desk, her movements slow and hesitant. She bends over the desk, her body shaking as she presents her ass to Evelyn.
The Master's words hang heavy in the air, the weight of his disapproval a physical presence in the room.

Evelyn approaches Lacey, the thin wooden paddle held firmly in her hand. The Master's voice rings out, clear and
commanding. "Twenty strokes."

Evelyn raises the paddle, her arm poised for the first strike. The room is silent, the tension palpable as she brings
the paddle down with a sharp, precise motion. The sound of the impact echoes through the room, Lacey's cry of pain
cutting through the silence.

"One... thank you," Lacey gasps out, her voice trembling with tears. Her body jerks with the impact, her fingers clawing
at the desk as she struggles to hold her position.

Evelyn's movements are slow and deliberate, each stroke measured and precise. She spreads the strikes evenly across
Lacey's ass, the paddle landing with a sharp, stinging impact each time. Lacey's cries grow louder with each stroke, her
body writhing with pain and humiliation.

"Two... thank you," she chokes out, her voice breaking with sobs.


continue


The room is filled with the sound of Lacey's sobs and the sharp, stinging impacts of the paddle against her flesh.
Evelyn's arm rises and falls with a steady rhythm, each stroke precise and unyielding. The air is thick with the scent
of Lacey's tears and the faint, underlying smell of fear and arousal.

"Three... thank you," Lacey gasps, her body jerking with each strike. Her ass begins to redden, the welts rising
quickly, a stark contrast against her pale skin. Jessie watches, her heart pounding in her chest, a mix of fear and
sympathy washing over her. She can't help but feel a twinge of guilt, knowing that her own actions had contributed to
Lacey's punishment.

"Four... thank you," Lacey cries out, her voice breaking with each word. Her fingers dig into the polished wood of the
desk, her knuckles white with strain. Her legs tremble, her body shaking with the effort to hold still.

Jim stands rigidly, his expression a mix of discomfort and something else-perhaps a hint of relief that the punishment
is not his to bear. His eyes flick between Lacey's writhing form and Evelyn's stern, focused expression.

Evelyn continues, her arm never wavering, her face an impassive mask. The paddle lands again and again, the sound of it
slicing through the air and the sharp crack against Lacey's flesh a relentless, brutal symphony.

"Ten... thank you," Lacey sobs, her voice barely a whisper. Her body is wracked with sobs, her breath coming in ragged,
desperate gasps. The room is filled with the sound of her cries, the sharp impacts of the paddle, and the occasional
harsh breath from Evelyn.

As the strokes continue, Lacey's ass becomes a mosaic of angry red welts, each one a testament to her pain and
humiliation. Her cries become more desperate, her body shaking with the force of her sobs.

"Fifteen... thank you," she manages to choke out, her voice a broken, desperate plea.


continue


By the time Evelyn reaches the twentieth stroke, Lacey's ass is a vivid, welted red, each stripe a stark reminder of her
punishment. Her cries have become a series of desperate, broken gasps, her body shaking with the force of her sobs. The
room is heavy with the scent of her tears and the faint, acrid smell of fear.

"Twenty...thank you," Lacey finally manages to whisper, her voice hoarse and raw. Her body slumps over the desk, her
breath coming in shuddering gasps. Evelyn steps back, her expression unreadable, the paddle held loosely in her hand.

The Master nods, his eyes flicking over Lacey's punished flesh with a critical gaze. "Stand up," he commands, his voice
firm. Lacey struggles to her feet, her body shaking, her face streaked with tears. She takes a deep, shuddering breath,
her hands trembling as she wipes her cheeks.

"Return to the line," Evelyn instructs, her voice soft but unyielding. Lacey complies, her steps slow and painful, her
eyes downcast. She takes her place in line, her body trembling, her ass a map of her humiliation.

The Master's gaze shifts to Jessie, his eyes narrowing slightly. "And what of you, Jessie?" he asks, his voice a low
purr. "Have you learned your lesson today? Or do you require further... instruction?"

Jessie's heart pounds in her chest, her body tense with anticipation and fear. She swallows hard, her mouth dry, her
palms slick with sweat. She can feel the weight of The Master's gaze, the intensity of his scrutiny a physical pressure
on her skin. The room is silent, the air thick with tension, the scent of Lacey's tears and the faint, underlying aroma
of leather and old books.

"I-I think so, Master," Jessie stammers, her voice barely above a whisper. She can feel her cock throbbing, her arousal
a betraying pulse against her thigh. She tries to hide her reaction, but the evidence is clear, her body responding
despite her best efforts to control it.


(Evelyn frowns and The Master chuckles, "oh, I think not". He reminds her that even after her whipping in the gym, she
still sought pleasure without permission. She touched Lacey without permission. The Master tells her that she clearly
cannot be trusted to her own passiona. He reaches into his desk and pulls out a polished steel device that he sets on
his desk. Jessie can see it closely resembles the chastity device on Lacey's penis. She takes a sharp breath. The Master
appraises her extremely excited cock. He orders Evelyn to give Jessie a taste. She dips her finger to scoop up the
precum and orders Jessie to open her mouth and then to suck. Jessie flushes with embarrassment as she obeys sucking the
salty fluid from Evelyn's finger)


The Master's chuckle sends a shiver down Jessie's spine, a cold, unsettling sensation that contrasts sharply with the
heat of her arousal. Evelyn's frown deepens, her eyes narrowing as she looks at Jessie, a mix of disapproval and
something more unsettling in her gaze.

"Oh, I think not," The Master says, his voice a low, amused rumble. He leans back in his chair, his eyes never leaving
Jessie's face. "Even after your whipping in the gym, you still sought pleasure without permission. You touched Lacey
without permission. Clearly, you cannot be trusted to control your own passions."

Jessie's breath catches in her throat, her heart pounding wildly. She watches as The Master reaches into his desk,
pulling out a polished steel device. He sets it on the desk, the metal glinting in the soft light of the study. Jessie
can see that it closely resembles the chastity device on Lacey's penis, the sight of it sending a wave of dread washing
over her.

"I see you recognize it," The Master says, a smirk playing at the corners of his mouth. He appraises Jessie's extremely
excited cock, his eyes lingering on the slick, wet tip. "Since you cannot be trusted to control yourself, we will have
to take measures to ensure your obedience."

Evelyn steps forward, her movements graceful and precise. She reaches out, her fingers tracing the length of Jessie's
cock, the touch light and teasing. Jessie gasps, her hips jerking slightly at the contact. Evelyn smirks, her eyes
gleaming with a mix of amusement and cruelty.

"Open your mouth," Evelyn commands, her voice soft but firm. Jessie complies, her mouth opening slightly, her breath
coming in quick, shallow gasps. Evelyn dips her finger into the pool of precum at the tip of Jessie's cock, the touch
sending a jolt of pleasure through her body. She brings her finger to Jessie's lips, the salty, bitter taste of her own
arousal filling her mouth as she sucks Evelyn's finger clean.

The room is silent, the air thick with tension and the scent of arousal.


(The Master comments that the device will be tricky to install with Jessie in such a state. He orders Lacey to assist
Jessie. Lacey drops to her knees before Jessie and begins to expertly suck Jessie's cock. After a minute of Jessie
moaning at the pleasure The Master announces that this needs to be wrapped up quickly. He nods to Evelyn who steps
behind Jessie. She licks her finger and reaches between Jessie's butt cheeks. Jessie is surprised at the contact and
even more surprised at the slick finger pressing against her anus. She bucks forward but Evelyn orders her to remain
still with a hiss. As Lacey continues sucking Jessie off, Evelyn expertly slides her finger into Jessie. Jessie gasps at
the sensation. It is a new feeling for her. Just them she catches Jim's eye and her face reddens deeply in
embarrassment. After just a few seconds of Evelyn's probing Jessie feels herself being overwhelmed by an orgasm. She
finds herself bucking back onto Evelyn's finger as her cock begins to ex'


The Master's eyes gleam with a mix of amusement and predatory intent as he watches the scene unfold. "It will be tricky
to install the device with you in such a state," he comments, his voice a low purr. "Lacey, assist her."

Lacey drops to her knees before Jessie, her movements smooth and practiced. She looks up at Jessie, her eyes filled with
a mix of sympathy and determination. Without hesitation, she takes Jessie's cock into her mouth, her lips wrapping
around the sensitive flesh. Jessie gasps, her hips jerking forward slightly as a wave of pleasure washes over her.

Lacey's technique is expert, her tongue swirling around the sensitive tip, her lips and mouth working in a rhythmic
dance that sends Jessie's senses spiraling. The room fills with the sounds of Jessie's moans, the soft slurping noises
of Lacey's mouth, and the occasional wet, sucking sound as she pulls back slightly before taking Jessie deeper.

The Master watches for a moment before nodding sharply. "This needs to be wrapped up quickly," he commands. Evelyn steps
behind Jessie, her movements silent and precise. She licks her finger, the sight sending a shiver down Jessie's spine.
Evelyn reaches between Jessie's butt cheeks, the cool, wet fingertip pressing against her anus.

Jessie is taken aback, her body tensing at the unexpected contact. She bucks forward slightly, a gasp escaping her lips
as Evelyn's finger presses firmly against her. "Stay still," Evelyn hisses, her voice a low, dangerous warning. Jessie
complies, her body trembling as she tries to remain motionless.

As Lacey continues to suck Jessie off, Evelyn expertly slides her finger into Jessie's anus, the sensation foreign and
intense. Jessie gasps, her body jerking slightly at the intrusion. The pleasure from Lacey's mouth and the new, intense
sensation from Evelyn's finger combine, overwhelming Jessie's senses.


continue


Jessie's breath hitches as Evelyn's finger slides deeper, the sensation of fullness and intrusion both alien and
electrifying. Lacey's mouth works relentlessly, her tongue swirling and sucking, driving Jessie closer to the edge. The
dual sensations are overwhelming, a maelstrom of pleasure that threatens to consume her entirely.

Jessie's eyes flutter closed, her head falling back as she struggles to maintain control. But the sight of Jim, standing
rigidly, his eyes locked onto Jessie's face, catches her attention. Jim's expression is a mix of fascination and
judgment, and the intensity of his gaze sends a fresh wave of embarrassment crashing over her. Her face reddens deeply,
the heat spreading down her neck and chest.

The room spins as the pleasure builds, the wet sounds of Lacey's mouth and the slick, rhythmic movements of Evelyn's
finger pushing Jessie towards the brink. She can feel the orgasm building, a tidal wave of sensation that threatens to
drown her. Her hips begin to move of their own accord, bucking back onto Evelyn's finger as she chases the impending
release.

"That's it," Evelyn murmurs, her voice a low, encouraging purr. "Let go, Jessie. Give in to it."

And then, with a final, desperate gasp, Jessie's orgasm crashes over her. Her body convulses, her cock pulsing as waves
of pleasure ripple through her. She bucks hard against Evelyn's finger, her body shuddering with the intensity of her
release. Lacey's mouth never stops, her tongue and lips working tirelessly, drawing out every last drop of pleasure.

The room is filled with the sounds of Jessie's moans, the wet sucking of Lacey's mouth, and the harsh, ragged breaths of
Evelyn as she works her finger in and out of Jessie's body. The scent of sex and arousal is thick in the air, a heady
perfume that clings to every surface.


(Evelyn does not give Jessie any time to enjoy the sensation. She steps back sliding her finger out and nods to Lacey
with a single word, "share". Lacey stands up and moves in to kiss Jessie on the lips. Jessie can see smears of cum there
and recoils. A sudden slap fro Evelyn halts her. Evelyn orders, "thank her for the pleasure with a kiss, girl." Jessie
closes her eyes and leans in to kiss Lacey. She is surprised when Lacey's tongue snakes into her mouth and is followed
by a gush of semen. Her eyes snap open to find Evelyn peering hard at her. once Lacey has filled Jessie's mouth with her
own cum she steps back wiping her mouth. Jessie looks at Evelyn and The Master who seem to be waiting. Even Lacey and
Jim are watching with expectation. Realizing what is expected, she swallows the sticky mess.)


The abrupt withdrawal of Evelyn's finger leaves Jessie feeling empty and vulnerable, the aftershocks of her orgasm still
rippling through her body. Before she can fully register the sensation, Evelyn steps back, her eyes narrowing as she
issues a single command: "Share."

Lacey stands up, her body glistening with a sheen of sweat, her eyes locked onto Jessie's. She moves in close, her lips
pressing against Jessie's in a sudden, unexpected kiss. Jessie can taste the remnants of her own cum on Lacey's lips,
the salty, bitter flavor filling her mouth. She recoils instinctively, her eyes widening in shock and disgust.

A sharp, stinging slap echoes through the room as Evelyn's hand connects with Jessie's cheek, the force of it snapping
her head to the side. "Thank her for the pleasure with a kiss, girl," Evelyn commands, her voice like a whip, cutting
through the air with authority.

Jessie's eyes flutter closed, a mix of shame and humiliation washing over her. She leans in, her lips pressing against
Lacey's once more. This time, she is met with the intrusion of Lacey's tongue, which snakes into her mouth, pushing the
cum deeper. Jessie's eyes snap open in surprise as she feels the warm, sticky fluid filling her mouth. She can see
Evelyn's stern gaze, The Master's expectant expression, and the watchful eyes of Lacey and Jim, all waiting for her to
comply.

Lacey pulls back slightly, a wicked smile playing on her lips as she continues to fill Jessie's mouth with her own
release. The taste is overpowering, the texture thick and slick. Jessie swallows hard, the muscles in her throat working
to force down the bitter, salty load.

Once Lacey has finished, she steps back, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand, a satisfied smirk on her face.
Jessie stands there, her chest heaving, her eyes darting between Evelyn, The Master, Lacey, and Jim. The room is silent,
the air thick with tension and the scent of sex and submission.


(Evelyn walks over to the desk , picks up the chastity device, walks back over to Jessie and sinks to her knees. As she
begins a fixing it, The Master explains the situation. It is a chastity cage. Jessie will wear it at all times. Evelyn
will hold the key. Yes, Jessie will be required to wear it home. No, she will not get to take it off. Only The Master
will decide when she gets a break. Now she will have no choice but to find her pleasure with them. You can pee just fine
with it sitting down. Keep it clean. Evelyn steps back, the cage glittering around Jessie's penis. She feels arousal
swelling her, but suddenly the cage is pressing in and preventing her erection)


The Master's voice is a low, commanding rumble as he begins to explain the situation, his eyes never leaving Jessie's
face. "This, Jessie, is a chastity cage. You will wear it at all times. Evelyn will hold the key. Yes, you will be
required to wear it home. No, you will not get to take it off. Only I will decide when you get a break."

Evelyn, kneeling before Jessie, begins to fasten the device, her fingers deft and precise. The cold metal of the cage
contrasts sharply with the heat of Jessie's skin, the sensation sending a shiver down her spine. The Master's words hang
heavy in the air, the finality of them a physical weight pressing down on Jessie's chest.

"Now you will have no choice but to find your pleasure through us," The Master continues, his voice a mix of amusement
and cruelty. "You can pee just fine with it on, sitting down. Keep it clean. We wouldn't want any infections, now would
we?"

Evelyn steps back, her eyes flicking over the cage, ensuring that it is secure. The metal glints in the soft light of
the study, a stark, gleaming reminder of Jessie's new reality. Jessie looks down, her eyes widening as she takes in the
sight of the cage encasing her penis, the sensation of it pressing against her flesh both alien and humiliating.

A wave of arousal washes over her, her body responding to the new sensation, the knowledge of her helplessness. But as
her arousal grows, the cage presses in, preventing her erection from fully forming. The sensation is frustrating, the
metal unyielding against her flesh. She tries to suppress her reaction, but her body betrays her, the partial erection
straining against the confines of the cage.

The Master watches her struggle, a smirk playing at the corners of his mouth. "I see you're already learning the limits
of your new situation," he comments, his voice laced with amusement. "Good. It's important that you understand the rules
from the start."


(they are dismissed to return to the locker room to dress. Once again Evelyn is ordered to stay behind. As they walk
down the hall they can softly hear the first moans as The Master takes his pleasures from his assistant.)


The dismissal comes abruptly, The Master's voice cutting through the tension-filled air of the study. "You are
dismissed. Return to the locker room to dress." His eyes flick to Evelyn, a silent command passing between them.
"Evelyn, stay behind."

Jessie, Lacey, and Jim exchange glances, the weight of The Master's words hanging heavy in the air. They turn and make
their way out of the study, the sound of their bare feet padding softly on the polished marble floor. The hallway is
dimly lit, the shadows long and dancing, the air cool against their heated skin.

As they walk, the soft sounds of moans and the rhythmic creaking of the desk begin to filter through the slightly ajar
door of the study. The unmistakable sounds of The Master taking his pleasure from Evelyn are a stark reminder of the
power dynamics at play, the humiliation and submission that permeate every aspect of their existence in this house.

Jessie's face flushes with a mix of embarrassment and arousal, the sensation of the chastity cage a constant,
humiliating reminder of her new reality. She can feel the weight of Lacey and Jim's gazes on her, their expressions a
mix of curiosity and sympathy.

The locker room is quiet, the air cool and damp from the earlier shower. The scent of soap and the faint, underlying
aroma of sex lingers in the air. The three of them stand there for a moment, the silence heavy and awkward.

"Well, I guess we should get dressed," Lacey says finally, her voice soft. She begins to rummage through the lockers,
her movements slow and deliberate. Jessie follows suit, her expression sullen as she pulls out her clothes, the chastity
device around her penis a constant, humiliating reminder of his own submission.


(fast forward a couple of weeks. Jessie has been doing well. she is working hard and the sessions in the gym have been
more successful. Though she has earned a whipping or two , mostly she has been met with approval from Evelyn. She has
not seen The Master since her caging. Even Jim has been civil to her. As she is finishing with a load of laundry. Evelyn
approaches her. She is told The Master is awaiting her in the study. She is to shower and present herself in just her
panties before his desk.)


The humdrum rhythm of Jessie's daily routine has become a familiar dance of submission and obedience. The days blend
into one another, each marked by the same rigid schedule of chores, exercise, and the ever-present weight of the
chastity cage. The gym sessions have become a grind, a test of endurance and will, but Jessie has found a strange sense
of pride in the approval she occasionally earns from Evelyn. The whip has become a less frequent visitor, but its memory
lingers, a constant reminder of the consequences of failure.

Jessie is folding a pile of neatly pressed linens, the soft fabric smooth under her fingers. The laundry room is warm,
the air filled with the scent of detergent and the faint hum of the dryer. The monotony of the task is soothing, a
welcome break from the physical demands of her training. As she finishes the last shirt, the door creaks open, and
Evelyn steps inside.

Evelyn's presence fills the room, her severe beauty and imposing aura a stark contrast to the mundane task at hand. She
looks Jessie over, her eyes critical but approving. "The Master is awaiting you in the study," she says, her voice firm
and unyielding. "You are to shower and present yourself in just your panties before his desk."

Jessie's heart skips a beat, the sudden command sending a wave of nervous anticipation through her body. She sets the
folded linens aside, her hands trembling slightly as she stands to attention. "Yes, Evelyn," she replies, her voice
steady despite the turmoil within her.

The shower is a quick, efficient affair. Jessie scrubs her skin until it's pink, the hot water stinging her flesh. She
can feel the chastity cage, a constant, humiliating reminder of her subjugation. As she steps out of the shower, she
dries herself off quickly, her movements brisk and efficient. She slips into a pair of plain white panties, the soft
fabric a stark contrast to the cold metal of the cage.


( The odd contours of the chastity device are clearly visible through the thin material. She walks to The Master's
study. There she finds The Master behind the desk, Evelyn to his right side, and Jim and Lacey to the other... they are
both fully dressed in their house uniform. I. the center of The Master's desk is a device that Jessie recognizes. It is
a steel butt plug with a red gem. Jessie feels the color drain from her face.)


The walk to The Master's study is a journey of growing dread and anticipation. Each step echoes through the grand
hallway, the sound of her bare feet on the polished floor a steady, rhythmic reminder of her impending confrontation.
The heavy wooden door to the study is slightly ajar, the soft glow of the fireplace within casting long, dancing shadows
across the threshold.

As Jessie pushes the door open, she finds herself in the familiar, opulent room. The Master sits behind his massive
desk, his eyes sharp and assessing as they meet hers. To his right stands Evelyn, her posture rigid and imposing, her
expression unreadable. To the left, Jim and Lacey stand at attention, both fully dressed in their house uniforms, their
faces impassive.

In the center of The Master's desk, glinting menacingly in the firelight, is a device that Jessie recognizes instantly.
It is a steel butt plug, its surface polished to a mirror finish, with a large, red gem embedded in the base. The sight
of it sends a chill down her spine, the color draining from her face as the implications of its presence sink in.

The Master's eyes flick over Jessie, taking in her appearance, the thin material of her panties doing little to hide the
contours of the chastity device. His gaze lingers on the red gem, a small, cruel smile playing at the corners of his
mouth. "Ah, Jessie," he begins, his voice a low purr. "Come in. We have been waiting for you."

Jessie steps forward, her heart pounding in her chest, her palms slick with sweat. The room is thick with tension, the
air heavy with the scent of aged leather, expensive cigars, and the faint, underlying aroma of the fireplace. She can
feel the weight of four pairs of eyes on her, the scrutiny a physical pressure that makes her want to shrink back.

Evelyn's gaze is particularly intense, her eyes flicking over Jessie's body, taking in every detail, every tremor of
fear and anticipation. Jim and Lacey stand rigidly, their expressions inscrutable, their presence a silent, watchful
reminder of Jessie's place in this world.


(The Master informs Jessie that she will wear this device at all times much like her chastity device. he notes that it
is on the larger side for someone new to the toy, but notes that will help it stay in place. Further, Evelyn will help
her stretch. At his word, Evelyn lets the robe she is wearing slide off her shoulders. Attached to her hips is a strapon
harness with a long black tapered dildo attached. the tip is narrow, about the breath of two fingers. the base, however
is quite thick. Jessie thinks it looks about as thick as the brief glimpse of she got of The Master's cock. When she
realizes that might be intentional, her blood runs cold. The Master informs get that she will be trained to associate
her penetration with pleasure. She will not cum without her butt filled in one way or another. He tells her that her
behavi5has earned her a release, and this is the only way she can have one)


The Master's voice is calm and measured, his eyes never leaving Jessie's face as he delivers his pronouncement. "Jessie,
you will wear this device at all times, much like your chastity device. It is on the larger side for someone new to such
toys, but that will help it stay in place."

Jessie's breath hitches as she listens, her eyes widening in shock and apprehension. The Master's words are clear and
unyielding, leaving no room for argument or escape.

"Evelyn will help you stretch," he continues, a cruel smile playing at the corners of his mouth. At his words, Evelyn
lets the silk robe she is wearing slip off her shoulders, revealing a strapon harness securely fastened around her hips.
Attached to the harness is a long, black tapered dildo, its tip narrow, about the width of two fingers, but the base
thick and imposing. Jessie's eyes widen as she takes in the sight, her blood running cold as she realizes that the base
of the dildo is roughly the same width as the brief glimpse she caught of The Master's cock.

The Master's gaze is intense, his eyes gleaming with a mix of amusement and predatory hunger. "You will be trained to
associate your penetration with pleasure. You will not cum without your butt filled in one way or another."

Jessie's heart pounds wildly in her chest, her body trembling as the weight of his words sinks in. The room spins
slightly, the air growing thick and heavy, the scent of leather and old books overwhelming her senses.

"Your behavior has earned you a release, and this is the only way you can have one," The Master says, his voice a low,
commanding rumble. He nods to Evelyn, who steps forward, the dildo swaying slightly with her movements. Jessie's eyes
are glued to the toy, her mind racing as she tries to process the implications of what is about to happen.


(Evelyn removes Jessie's chastity cage. Her cock immediately swells betraying her excitement in the face of fear. Evelyn
reached out and gently strokes Jessie's cock. She gathers a drop of precum and has Jessie suck it off her finger. Then
she presses Jessie's back and bends her over the desk. She begins by applying lube to her finger and pressing it into
Jessie's tight hole)


The study is filled with a tense, charged silence as Evelyn steps closer to Jessie, her movements deliberate and
precise. The air is thick with anticipation and the faint, underlying scent of leather and old books. Jessie's breath
comes in short, ragged gasps, her heart pounding wildly in her chest as she watches Evelyn's every move.

Evelyn's hands are steady as she reaches down and unlocks the chastity cage, the metal clinking softly as it falls away.
Jessie's cock immediately swells, betraying her excitement despite the fear coursing through her veins. The sight of her
arousal is met with a small, satisfied smirk from Evelyn, who reaches out to gently stroke Jessie's length. The touch is
feather-light, almost teasing, sending a shiver down Jessie's spine.

Evelyn's fingers are cool and slick as she gathers a drop of precum from the tip of Jessie's cock, her eyes never
leaving Jessie's face. She brings her finger to Jessie's lips, her voice soft but firm. "Clean it off." Jessie hesitates
for a moment, the embarrassment and humiliation washing over her, but she complies, sucking the salty fluid from
Evelyn's finger.

Evelyn's eyes gleam with satisfaction as she steps back slightly, her hands moving to Jessie's shoulders. She presses
gently, guiding Jessie to bend over the desk. The polished wood is cool against her cheeks, the surface smooth and
unyielding. Jessie's breath hitches as she feels Evelyn's body press against her, the heat and pressure a stark contrast
to the cool desk.

Evelyn reaches for a small bottle of lube, her movements efficient and practiced. The cap clicks open, and the scent of
the lubricant fills the air, a sweet and slightly medicinal aroma that does little to ease Jessie's nerves. Evelyn
applies a generous amount to her fingers, the cool gel contrasting with the warmth of her skin.

Evelyn's fingers, slick with lube, press gently against Jessie's tight, virgin hole. Jessie tenses instinctively, a soft
gasp escaping her lips as she feels the initial pressure. "Relax," Evelyn murmurs, her voice a low, soothing purr. "It
will be easier if you relax."

Jessie takes a deep, shuddering breath, trying to force her muscles to loosen. The Master watches from his seat, his
eyes gleaming with a mix of amusement and anticipation. Jim and Lacey stand to the side, their expressions inscrutable,
but their eyes are fixed on the scene unfolding before them.

Evelyn's finger presses gently but firmly, the tip slipping past the initial resistance. Jessie's body jerks slightly, a
soft moan escaping her lips as she feels the intrusion. The sensation is foreign and intense, a mix of discomfort and a
strange, growing pleasure. Evelyn's finger slides deeper, the lubrication easing the way, stretching Jessie's tight
muscle.

"That's it," Evelyn whispers, her voice encouraging. "Just relax and let it happen." She slowly works her finger in and
out, the movements deliberate and calculated, preparing Jessie for what is to come. Jessie's breath comes in short,
ragged gasps, her body trembling as she struggles to accept the intrusion.

The Master's gaze is intense, his eyes never leaving Jessie's face, taking in every flicker of emotion, every gasp and
moan. "She's doing well," he comments, his voice a low rumble. "Continue, Evelyn."

Evelyn nods slightly, her focus unwavering. She adds a second finger, the stretch more pronounced, the sensation more
intense. Jessie's body tenses again, a soft cry escaping her lips, but she forces herself to relax, to accept the
intrusion. The burn is replaced by a growing warmth, a strange, aching pleasure that spreads through her body.


continue


Evelyn works her fingers gently but firmly, scissoring them to stretch Jessie's tight muscle. The initial discomfort
begins to ebb, replaced by a dull, throbbing ache that sends shivers of anticipation down Jessie's spine. The room is
filled with the soft, wet sounds of Evelyn's fingers moving in and out, the occasional gasp from Jessie, and the heavy,
expectant breaths of those watching.

"You're doing so well, Jessie," Evelyn murmurs, her voice a mix of approval and seduction. "Just a little more. You can
take it."

Jessie's fingers clutch at the edge of the desk, her knuckles turning white as she struggles to maintain her composure.
The sensation of being filled, of being stretched and explored, is both humiliating and exhilarating. She can feel the
Master's gaze on her, the weight of his scrutiny a tangible force that both terrifies and arouses her.

After what feels like an eternity, Evelyn withdraws her fingers, leaving Jessie feeling empty and exposed. The cool air
of the study brushes against her slick, stretched opening, sending a fresh wave of sensation through her body. She hears
the sound of a bottle being uncapped again, and then the slick, wet sound of lube being applied to something larger and
thicker.

Evelyn presses the narrow tip of the dildo against Jessie's entrance, the cool metal a stark contrast to the heat of her
body. Jessie tenses, a soft whimper escaping her lips as she anticipates the intrusion. "Shh," Evelyn soothes, her hand
gently stroking Jessie's back. "Take a deep breath and push out against it. It will make it easier."

Jessie does as she is told, taking a deep, shuddering breath and pushing out. The tip of the dildo slips inside, the
stretch more intense than Evelyn's fingers. Jessie's body convulses slightly, a soft cry escaping her lips as she
struggles to accept the intrusion. Evelyn pauses, allowing Jessie to adjust to the sensation before slowly pushing the
dildo deeper.


continue


Jessie's breath hitches as the dildo slides inch by inch into her, the sensation of being filled both overwhelming and
intense. The initial burn gives way to a deep, pulsating ache, a mix of discomfort and a strange, dark pleasure.
Evelyn's hands are steady on Jessie's hips, guiding her gently but firmly, ensuring that she takes every inch.

The room is thick with tension, the air heavy with the scent of lube and the faint, underlying aroma of sex. The Master
watches with a predatory gleam in his eyes, his breath coming slightly faster, his interest piqued by Jessie's struggle
and submission. Jim and Lacey stand to the side, their expressions a mix of curiosity and arousal, the scene unfolding
before them a stark reminder of their own subjugation and The Master's control.

"That's it," Evelyn murmurs, her voice a low, encouraging purr. "You're doing so well, Jessie. Just a little more." She
presses gently but insistently, the dildo sliding deeper until it is about halfway sheathed within Jessie. Jessie's body
trembles, her breath coming in short, ragged gasps, her fingers clutching at the desk for support.

Evelyn begins to move the dildo, slow, deliberate thrusts that send waves of sensation crashing through Jessie's body.
The initial discomfort begins to fade, replaced by a growing heat, a throbbing pleasure that spreads from her core
outward. Jessie's hips start to move in sync with Evelyn's thrusts, her body betraying her arousal despite the
humiliation and fear. With every thrust, Evelyn's cock inches deeper into Jessie and stretches her more.

The Master's eyes are locked onto Jessie's face, taking in every flicker of emotion, every gasp and moan. "Look at her,"
he comments, his voice a low rumble. "She's a natural. Isn't she, Evelyn?"

Evelyn's response is a soft, satisfied hum, her movements never faltering. "Yes, Master. She's learning quickly."

The dildo continues to move in and out of Jessie, the sensations building, the pleasure growing more intense with each
thrust.


(As Jessie begins to pant and hump her hips back at Evelyn, The Master calls out an order to Jim to be the receptical.
Jim's face flashes with anger and disgust, but he obeys instantly. He gets on his knees between Jessie And the desk. He
wraps his lips around Jessie's cock. He doesn't move his head, but as Evelyn thrusts in and out of Jessie, her cock is
driven deeper into Jim's waiting mouth. Finally, Jessie can take no more of the sensation. She explodes in orgasm. Jim
stands to kiss her and accept her thanks. this time Jessie swallows her cum without hesitation.)


The room is thick with the scent of sex and the heavy, ragged breaths of those within it. Jessie's body is flushed, her
skin glistening with a sheen of sweat as she pants and humps her hips back against Evelyn's thrusts. The dildo moves in
and out of her, each stroke sending waves of pleasure crashing through her body, the sensation overwhelming and intense.

The Master's voice cuts through the haze of Jessie's arousal, his command sharp and unyielding. "Jim, be the
receptacle." Jim's face flashes with a mix of anger and disgust, but obedience is ingrained deeply within him. He drops
to his knees between Jessie and the desk, his movements swift and efficient despite his reluctance.

Jessie's eyes widen as she sees Jim's lips wrap around her cock. Jim doesn't move his head, his eyes filled with a
mixture of defiance and submission. As Evelyn continues to thrust into Jessie, the dildo pushes Jessie's cock deeper
into Jim's mouth, the sensation of being enveloped in wet, warm heat sending Jessie's senses spiraling.

Jim's mouth is a tight, wet vise around Jessie's cock, the sensation of being sucked and fucked at the same time almost
too much to bear. Jessie's hips move in sync with Evelyn's thrusts, her body betraying her arousal, her moans filling
the room. The dual sensations of being filled and pleasuring another are overwhelming, the pleasure building to a
crescendo.

The Master watches, his eyes gleaming with satisfaction and arousal. "That's it," he murmurs, his voice a low,
encouraging purr. "Give in to it, Jessie. Let go."

Jessie's body tenses, her breath hitching as the pleasure reaches its peak. With a final, desperate thrust from Evelyn,
Jessie's orgasm crashes over her. She cries out, her body convulsing as waves of pleasure ripple through her. Her cock
pulses, releasing into Jim's waiting mouth, the sensation of her release sending shockwaves of ecstasy through her body.

Jim stands up, his face impassive despite the humiliation and disgust he must feel.

As Jessie's orgasm subsides, she is left panting and trembling, her body slick with sweat and her mind reeling from the
intensity of the experience. Jim stands before her, his expression a mix of resignation and quiet defiance. The Master's
gaze is locked onto Jessie, a smirk playing at the corners of his mouth, satisfaction gleaming in his eyes.

Jim leans in, his lips pressing against Jessie's in a harsh, unyielding kiss. Jessie's eyes flutter closed, her body
still throbbing with the aftershocks of her orgasm. She can taste the faint, salty residue of her own release on Jim's
lips, the taste a bitter reminder of her submission. This time, there is no hesitation as Jessie parts her lips,
allowing Jim to push his tongue into her mouth, forcing her to swallow the remnants of her own pleasure. The Master
watches, his eyes gleaming with approval.

Evelyn, her breath coming in steady, controlled breaths, slowly withdraws the dildo from Jessie's body. The sudden
emptiness is a stark contrast to the fullness she had grown accustomed to, leaving her feeling both relieved and
strangely empty. She remains bent over the desk, her body trembling slightly as she struggles to regain her composure.

The Master's voice cuts through the silence, his tone firm and commanding. "Very good, Jessie. You've earned your
release today. Remember, this is the only way you will find pleasure from now on. Your body belongs to us, and we will
use it as we see fit."

Jessie's breath hitches at his words, the weight of his statement settling heavily on her shoulders. She can feel the
cool air of the study against her exposed, sensitive flesh, the contrast a stark reminder of her vulnerability and
submission.


(Evelyn places the butt plug. Jessie still feels some stretch but her ass swallows the plug without too much effort. She
is told to stand. Evelyn replaces the chastity cage and hands Jessie her panties. The servants are dismissed with Evelyn
staying behind to service The Master. the familiar sounds of The Master claiming Evelyns body ring out as Jessie walks
to the locker room to clean up)


The room is thick with the scent of sex and the weight of unspoken words as Evelyn prepares to secure the butt plug in
place. Her hands are steady and precise as she applies a generous amount of lube to the cooled steel surface. The red
gem at the base glints menacingly in the soft light of the study, a stark reminder of Jessie's new reality.

Jessie feels the cool metal press against her entrance, the stretch more familiar now but no less intense. She takes a
deep breath, pushing out as Evelyn had instructed earlier. The plug slides in smoothly, the wider base stretching her
muscles, filling her completely. The sensation is both humiliating and strangely comforting, a constant reminder of her
submission and The Master's control.

"Good girl," Evelyn murmurs, her voice a low purr of approval. She pats Jessie's buttocks gently, the sound echoing in
the quiet room. "Stand up straight."

Jessie complies, her body trembling slightly as she pushes herself upright. The plug shifts inside her, the sensation
sending a shiver down her spine. Evelyn's hands move to the chastity cage, securing it back in place around Jessie's
now-softening cock. The metal is cold and unyielding, a stark contrast to the heat of Jessie's skin.

Evelyn hands Jessie her panties, her expression stern but approving. "Clean yourself up," she commands, her voice firm.
"And remember, this stays in place until The Master decides otherwise."

The servants are dismissed with a wave of The Master's hand. Jim and Lacey exit the room without a word, their
expressions inscrutable. As the door closes behind them, the familiar sounds of The Master's pleasure fill the air. The
soft moans and the rhythmic creaking of the desk are a stark reminder of the power dynamics at play, the humiliation and
submission that permeate every aspect of their existence in this house.


(the next weekend when Jessie shows up in the morning, Evelyn informs her that she will have a special duty tonight. The
Master will be having company and Jessie will act as his bedservant. Jessie doesn't know exactly what it entails, but
she feels anxious all the same. Evelyn informs her that they must do something about her hair. Jessie's hair has gotten
a bit shaggy. Evelyn informs her that they will be making a trip to the salon. Before they go out, though, Jessie must
be presentable for the public. Jessie gets extremely nervous to be seen in public dressed en femme)


The morning sun filters through the tall windows of the mansion, casting long shadows across the polished floors as
Jessie makes her way to Evelyn's office. The anticipation of the unknown duty weighing heavily on her mind, Jessie's
heart pounds in her chest, her palms slick with nervous sweat.

Evelyn stands by the window, her severe beauty accentuated by the soft morning light. She turns as Jessie enters, her
expression unreadable but her eyes sharp and assessing. "Jessie," she begins, her voice firm and commanding, "tonight
you will have a special duty. The Master will be having company, and you will act as his bedservant."

Jessie's breath hitches, her mind racing with a mix of fear and curiosity. She doesn't know exactly what being a
bedservant entails, but the very thought sends a shiver down her spine. "What does that mean, Evelyn?" Jessie asks, her
voice barely above a whisper.

Evelyn's lips curve into a small, cruel smile. "You will find out in due time. For now, we need to make sure you are
presentable. Your hair has gotten a bit shaggy, and we must do something about that."

Jessie's hands instinctively go to her hair, her fingers running through the slightly overgrown strands. The thought of
going to a salon, of being seen in public dressed en femme, sends a wave of anxiety crashing through her. "Do we have to
go out?" Jessie asks, her voice trembling slightly. "What if someone recognizes me?"

Evelyn's expression hardens, her eyes narrowing as she steps closer to Jessie. "You will do as you are told, Jessie,"
she says, her voice a low growl. "The Master has made his wishes clear, and you will obey. Now, go to the closet and put
on the outfit I've laid out for you. We have a salon appointment, and you need to look the part."


(Jessie finds a yellow sundress with matching white bra and panties. There are also some wedge sandals with 2 inch
heels. Handing with them is a brown leather purse. A pair of very feminine sunglasses accompanies a floppy straw sun
hat. Jessie's heart beats fast. This is far more feminine than she has ever had to dress before.)


Jessie's heart pounds in her chest as she steps into the closet, the soft light filtering through the sheer curtains
casting a warm glow on the neatly arranged outfits. Her eyes widen as she takes in the ensemble laid out for her. The
yellow sundress is bright and feminine, the fabric light and breezy, with a floral pattern that seems to dance in the
soft light. The matching white bra and panties are delicate and lacey, a stark contrast to the utilitarian undergarments
she has grown accustomed to.

The wedge sandals are a pale yellow, the two-inch heels adding a height and elegance she has never had to navigate
before. The brown leather purse is small and stylish, with a delicate clasp and a thin strap that will hang over her
shoulder. Beside it lies a pair of large, feminine sunglasses with round, cat-eye frames, and a floppy straw sun hat
adorned with a wide ribbon.

Jessie's hands tremble as she picks up the sundress, the soft fabric sliding through her fingers. The thought of wearing
something so overtly feminine in public sends a wave of panic through her. She has dressed en femme before, but never in
something so bright, so noticeable. She quickly changes into the bra and panties, the lace soft against her skin but a
constant reminder of her transformation.

As she slips into the sundress, she can feel the fabric hugging her curves, the skirt swishing gently around her thighs.
The sandals are a challenge, her feet unsteady on the heels, but she manages to secure them after a few attempts. The
purse feels alien in her hand, the sunglasses perched on her nose, and the hat tilted slightly to the side, casting a
shadow over her eyes.

She takes a deep breath, her heart still racing as she steps out of the closet to face Evelyn. The room seems to tilt
slightly, the world outside the familiar walls of the mansion feeling both exciting and terrifying.


(Evelyn is pleased circling Jessie once. Evelyn grabs her own bag and they sweep down the hall to the garage. In the
garage they find a car waiting for them. It is a black towncar with Jim waiting in the driver's seat. When he sees them,
he jumps up and opens the back doors for each in turn. He even smiles at Jessie and compliments her cute dress. They
drive into town and pull up at Enchante, an upscale salon)


Evelyn's eyes gleam with approval as she circles Jessie, her gaze taking in every detail of the ensemble. She nods once,
a small, satisfied smile playing at the corners of her mouth. "Very good, Jessie. You look presentable. Let's go."

Jessie follows Evelyn down the grand hallway, her heels clicking softly on the polished marble floor. The purse hangs
awkwardly from her shoulder, the sunglasses perched on her nose, and the floppy hat tilting slightly with each step. Her
heart pounds in her chest, her nerves on high alert as she prepares to face the world outside the mansion's protective
walls.

As they enter the garage, the cool air is a stark contrast to the warmth of the house. The scent of oil and rubber fills
the air, the dim lighting casting long shadows across the polished concrete floor. A sleek, black town car waits for
them, its engine purring softly. Jim stands by the back door, his uniform crisp and neat, a smile plastered on his face.

"Good morning, Evelyn," Jim greets, his voice polite and respectful. His eyes flick to Jessie, and his smile widens, a
genuine warmth in his gaze. "Jessie, you look absolutely adorable in that dress. It really suits you."

Jessie blushes deeply, her cheeks flushing with a mix of embarrassment and pleasure at the unexpected compliment. She
murmurs a soft "thank you," her voice barely audible as she slides into the back seat of the town car. Evelyn follows,
her movements graceful and confident, settling into the seat beside Jessie.

The car door closes with a soft thud, and Jim takes his place in the driver's seat. The engine revs to life, the hum
filling the car as they pull out of the garage and onto the winding driveway. The mansion's gates creak open, revealing
the bustling world beyond.


continue


The town car glides smoothly through the iron gates, the wheels crunching softly on the gravel driveway before
transitioning to the smooth pavement of the main road. The countryside blurs past the windows, the lush greenery and
towering trees a stark contrast to the opulence and confinement of the mansion. Jessie's heart races as they approach
the town, her nerves growing more taut with each passing mile.

The town is bustling with activity, the streets lined with shops and cafes, people strolling leisurely under the bright
morning sun. The car navigates the crowded streets with ease, Jim's hands steady on the wheel, his eyes focused on the
road ahead. Jessie's breath hitches as they pass other vehicles, her reflection in the window showing a stranger-a young
woman in a vibrant yellow sundress, sunglasses perched on her nose, a floppy hat tilting adorably to the side.

Evelyn, seemingly unmoved by the world outside, sits with her back straight, her eyes fixed on the road ahead. Her
presence is a steady, calming force, a reminder of the control and discipline that governs Jessie's life.

The town car pulls up in front of Enchant, an upscale salon nestled among other high-end boutiques and restaurants.
The building is elegant, with large windows that reveal the sleek, modern interior. The sign above the door shimmers in
the sunlight, the name "Enchant" written in an elegant, flowing script.

Jim steps out of the car, opening the door for Evelyn first, then for Jessie. As Jessie emerges from the car, she feels
the weight of curious gazes, the whispers of passersby. Her heart pounds in her chest, her palms slick with sweat, but
she takes a deep breath, straightening her shoulders as she follows Evelyn towards the salon.


(Evelyn should be greeted by an elegant middle aged woman. The woman tells her that they have a chair waiting for her
girl. The woman steps up to Jessie and says she wants to see what they will be working with. Evelyn nudges Jessie and
glances at the hat. Jessie nervously removes the hat and holds it in her hands her eyes downcast to the floor. The woman
clucks and circles Jessie looking at her hair. When Jessie first arrived at The Master's manor house as Jason, the hair
had been a somewhat grown out men's cut. Short on the sides and longer on top. Now, it had grown out into a shameless
shag of red hair. Evelyn asks the Matron for her thoughts. She announces that they will rescue the mess with a pixie cut
while "the girl" learns to keep her hair decent as it grows out. Another woman, a young stylish brunette with a low cut
shirt and piercings in her nose takes Jessie to the back to wash her hair Soon she is seated in the salon chair as the
woman begins to cut her hair)


The bell above the salon door chimes softly as Evelyn and Jessie enter Enchant. The interior is a symphony of
elegance and modernity, with sleek black and chrome chairs, polished marble floors, and soft, ambient lighting. The air
is filled with the scent of expensive shampoos and conditioners, the hum of quiet conversation and the occasional snip
of scissors.

An elegant middle-aged woman, dressed in a tailored suit that exudes professionalism and sophistication, greets them at
the door. Her hair is styled in a chic bob, her makeup flawless. She extends a perfectly manicured hand to Evelyn.
"Evelyn, darling, it's always a pleasure. We have a chair waiting for your girl." Her voice is warm and welcoming, her
eyes twinkling with a mix of curiosity and approval.

She turns her attention to Jessie, her gaze taking in every detail of the ensemble. "And who do we have here?" she asks,
her voice softening as she steps closer to Jessie. "Let's see what we're working with."

Evelyn nudges Jessie gently, glancing at the floppy hat. Jessie's hands tremble slightly as she removes the hat, holding
it tightly in her hands. Her eyes remain downcast, fixed on the polished marble floor, her cheeks flushed with
embarrassment. The stylist clucks her tongue, circling Jessie like a predator assessing its prey, her eyes critical as
she examines the shaggy red hair.

Evelyn, standing nearby, watches the exchange with a satisfied smirk. "What are your thoughts, Matron?" she asks, her
voice cool and composed.

The Matron pauses, her fingers gently lifting a strand of Jessie's hair, assessing its texture and length. "Well," she
begins, her voice thoughtful, "we'll need to rescue this mess with a pixie cut. It's the best way to start fresh and
teach 'the girl' to keep her hair decent as it grows out."


continue


The Matron's words hang in the air, a final judgment on Jessie's current state. Jessie's heart sinks, but she remains
silent, her eyes still fixed on the floor. The thought of losing her hair, of being stripped of even this small piece of
her former self, sends a shiver down her spine.

A young, stylish brunette with a low-cut shirt and a nose piercing steps forward, her eyes taking in Jessie with a mix
of curiosity and professionalism. "Follow me, sweetheart," she says, her voice friendly but firm. "Let's get you cleaned
up."

Jessie follows the stylist to the back of the salon, her heels clicking softly on the marble floor. The washing station
is sleek and modern, with a comfortable basin and a selection of high-end hair products. The stylist gestures for Jessie
to sit, and she complies, her heart pounding in her chest as the stylist begins to wet her hair, the warm water a stark
contrast to the cool air of the salon.

The stylist's hands are gentle but efficient, her fingers massaging Jessie's scalp as she lathers in the shampoo. The
scent of lavender and mint fills the air, the sensation surprisingly soothing despite Jessie's nerves. The stylist
rinses Jessie's hair, the water cascading down her back, before applying a generous amount of conditioner. She combs
through Jessie's hair, the strands tangling slightly, a testament to their unruly state.

Once Jessie's hair is clean and conditioned, the stylist leads her back to the salon floor, where the Matron and Evelyn
are waiting. The Matron gestures to a sleek black chair, and Jessie takes a seat, her heart racing as she looks at
herself in the large mirror. The reflection staring back at her is one of a stranger-a young woman with shaggy red hair,
her cheeks flushed, and her eyes wide with a mix of fear and anticipation.


continue


The chair is adjusted to a comfortable height, and the Matron steps behind Jessie, her hands gently tilting Jessie's
head to examine her hair from all angles. The stylish brunette who washed Jessie's hair steps back in, holding a pair of
sharp, gleaming scissors. She snaps on a pair of black gloves, the latex stretching taut over her hands, and a cape is
draped over Jessie to protect her clothing from any stray hair.

The Matron's voice is firm and authoritative as she begins to direct the stylist. "Start with the sides, nice and short.
We want a clean, sharp line. Then we'll work on the top, leaving it just long enough to style but not so long it becomes
unmanageable."

Jessie watches in the mirror as the stylist lifts a section of her hair, the scissors snipping through the strands with
a soft, almost soothing sound. The first cut sends a jolt of nervous energy through Jessie's body, but she remains
still, her eyes fixed on the falling locks. The stylist works methodically, her movements precise and confident, the
scissors gliding through Jessie's hair with ease.

The salon is filled with the soft hum of conversation and the occasional snip of scissors, the sound a stark contrast to
the pounding of Jessie's heart. Evelyn watches from a nearby chair, her expression inscrutable, her eyes taking in every
detail of the transformation.

The stylist steps back, her eyes critical as she assesses her work. She nods, satisfied, and begins to work on the top,
leaving it slightly longer than the sides but still short and neat. The Matron steps in, her fingers combing through the
newly cut hair, shaping it into a stylish pixie cut that frames Jessie's face.

The transformation is dramatic. The shaggy, unruly hair is gone, replaced by a sleek, modern cut that accentuates
Jessie's features. The Matron steps back, a satisfied smile on her lips. "There," she says, her voice approving. "A much
better look for you, sweetheart."


(the Matron asks Evelyn if the girl will need a bit of tending down below. Evelyn nods, and the young girl leads them to
the back room. Jessie is terrified of what might come next. Her fears are justified as The girl asks her to undress and
climb up on the table. After she's down to her panties and bra the girl giggles and tells her the panties, too. Jessie
blushes deeply and begins to protest. Evelyn tells her sharply to do as she is told. Jessie slowly slides the panties
down her legs and off emba6deeply as the girl surveys her chastity cage)


The Matron turns to Evelyn, her voice low and discreet. "Will the girl need a bit of tending down below?" she asks, her
eyes flicking to Jessie with a knowing glance. Evelyn nods, her expression unreadable but her intent clear.

The young stylist, her eyes sparkling with a mix of curiosity and mischief, leads them to a private back room. The space
is dimly lit, the air filled with the scent of disinfectant and a hint of something sweet and floral. A padded
examination table stands in the center, surrounded by various tools and supplies.

Jessie's heart pounds in her chest as she takes in the room, her mind racing with dread and uncertainty. The stylist
turns to her, her voice bright and cheerful. "Alright, sweetheart, let's get you ready. Hop up on the table and undress
for me."

Jessie's hands tremble as she begins to unbutton her sundress, her fingers fumbling with the tiny buttons. She slides
the dress off her shoulders, letting it pool at her feet. She stands in her white lace bra and panties, her cheeks
flushing a deep crimson as she crosses her arms over her chest, trying to hide her modesty.

The stylist giggles, a sound that sends a shiver down Jessie's spine. "The panties too, sweetheart," she says, her eyes
twinkling with amusement. "We need to see everything."

Jessie hesitates, her eyes flicking to Evelyn for support, but Evelyn's expression is stern, her voice sharp as she
commands, "Do as you're told, Jessie. Now." The Matron steps out of the room, leaving the three of them alone.

Jessie's hands shake as she hooks her thumbs into the waistband of her panties, slowly sliding them down her legs. She
steps out of them, her body trembling as she stands before the stylist in nothing but her bra and the steel chastity
cage. The room is silent except for the soft hum of the ventilation system, the weight of the moment heavy in the air.


(Evelyn removes Jessie's cage and steps back. Though she is terrified, Jessie's cock immediately begins to swell. The
stylist co ks an eye and watches Jessie's cock rise to full attention. She says it's fine, and will make things easier
anyway. She inspects Jessie's pubic hair. It isn't terribly long, but remains thick and bushy. The girl clucks as she
pokes at the edges of the bush strategizing. She asks Evelyn what all needs attention. Evelyn announces chest, legs and
bush. Leave a neat short stripe above. Then she turns to leave and says over her shoulder, oh and of course the ass.)


The room feels smaller, the air thicker as Evelyn steps forward, her movements precise and efficient. She unlocks the
chastity cage with a soft click, the metal cool against Jessie's heated skin. As the cage is removed, Jessie's cock
immediately begins to swell, betraying his arousal despite the terror coursing through his veins. The stylist raises an
eyebrow, a smirk playing at the corners of her mouth as she watches Jessie's cock rise to full attention.

"Well, isn't that convenient," the stylist murmurs, her voice laced with amusement. "This will make things easier
anyway."

She steps closer, her eyes critical as she inspects Jessie's pubic hair. It's not terribly long, but it's thick and
bushy, a stark contrast to the smooth, sleek lines of the salon. She clucks her tongue, her fingers gently poking at the
edges, strategizing her approach.

"So, what all needs attention?" she asks, her eyes flicking to Evelyn.

Evelyn's voice is cool and composed as she responds, "Chest, legs, and the bush. Leave a neat, short stripe above. And
of course, the ass." She turns to leave, her heels clicking softly on the tiled floor. Over her shoulder, she adds,
"Make sure it's all smooth and presentable. The Master has high standards."

The stylist nods, a determined look in her eyes. "Got it. Hop up on the table, sweetheart. Let's get started."

Jessie hesitates for a moment, his heart pounding in his chest. The thought of being completely bare, of being exposed
in such an intimate way, sends a wave of panic through him. But Evelyn's command echoes in his mind, and he knows he has
no choice. He climbs onto the table, his body trembling slightly as he lies back, his eyes fixed on the ceiling.

The stylist prepares her tools, the soft hum of the electric razor filling the room. She starts with Jessie's chest, the
razor buzzing softly as she glides it over his skin, the hairs falling away in a neat, even line.


(always use feminine pronouns for Jessie. Nearly an hour of pain from the waxing and embarrassment later, Jessie is bare
below the eyebrows except for a neat red strip above her crotch. The girl examines her work ever grasping Jessie's penis
to move it side to side to check her work. Jessie involuntarily moans and blushes deeply. the girl comments that it must
have been a while and mischievously strokes up and down Jessie's cock a few times. Jessie sighs and squirms. The girl
teases her for a few more moments and then regretfully steps away. She cracks the door to tell Evelyn they are finished.
Evelyn inspects Jessie even having her bend over and spread her cheeks. The stylist giggles and leers. Evelyn approves.
She announces that the cage needs to go back on, but Jessie's condition will make that difficult)

The room is thick with the scent of wax and the lingering hum of the electric razor. Jessie's body is slick with a sheen
of sweat, her skin red and sensitive from the thorough waxing. The stylist steps back, her eyes critically assessing her
handiwork. Jessie's body is smooth and hairless below the eyebrows, except for a neat, red stripe above her crotch, a
stark contrast to the rest of her bare skin. The stylist's hands are gentle but firm as she grasps Jessie's penis,
moving it side to side to check her work. Jessie's breath hitches, a deep blush spreading across her cheeks as she lets
out an involuntary moan.

"Well, well, it seems it's been a while, hasn't it?" the stylist teases, a mischievous glint in her eyes. She strokes up
and down Jessie's cock a few times, her touch light but deliberate, sending shivers of pleasure through Jessie's body.
Jessie sighs, her hips squirming slightly, her breath coming in short, ragged gasps.

The stylist chuckles, her fingers lingering for a few more moments before she regretfully steps away. "All done,
sweetheart," she says, her voice laced with amusement. "You're as smooth as a baby's bottom."

She cracks the door open, her voice softening as she calls out to Evelyn. "We're all finished here."

Evelyn enters the room, her heels clicking softly on the tiled floor. Her eyes take in Jessie's transformed body, her
gaze sharp and assessing. She circles Jessie, her fingers tracing the smooth lines of her skin, her touch cool and
professional.

"Very good," Evelyn murmurs, her voice approving. She pauses, her eyes narrowing as she considers Jessie's erect cock.
"But we have a problem."

Evelyn's voice is firm as she commands, "Bend over and spread your cheeks." Jessie complies, her heart pounding in her
chest as she bends over, her hands reaching back to spread herself open.


(Evelyn lubes up the butt plug and works it into Jessie's tight hole. The stylist watches her mouth open and her eyes
glittering. Evelyn decides the only way Jessie is going to get back into the cage any time soon is if she is granted
release. She steps towards Jessie, but the stylist clears her throat. She shyly asks Evelyn if she can help since she
got Jessie into the state in a way. Evelyn says very well, but every drop of her cum is to go down Jessie's throat.
Jessie blushes deeply as the stylist approaches and gently pushes Jessie back onto the table)


The room grows quiet as Evelyn turns her attention to the steel butt plug lying on the table. She picks it up, her
fingers glistening with lube as she prepares it for insertion. The stylist watches, her mouth slightly agape, eyes
glittering with a mix of fascination and lust. Evelyn's movements are precise and deliberate, her focus unwavering as
she positions herself behind Jessie.

Jessie's breath hitches as she feels the cool, lubed tip of the butt plug press against her tight hole. She takes a deep
breath, pushing out as Evelyn had taught her, allowing the plug to slide in more easily. The sensation of being filled
is both humiliating and strangely comforting, a constant reminder of her submission.

Evelyn works the plug in slowly, her fingers gentle but firm, ensuring it is seated fully. Jessie's body trembles, her
cheeks flushed with a deep blush as she lies there, exposed and vulnerable. The stylist's eyes never leave Jessie's
body, her breath coming in soft, excited gasps.

Evelyn steps back, her eyes assessing Jessie's state. Her cock is still hard, the chastity cage a distant impossibility
in this condition. Evelyn's lips curve into a small, cruel smile as she considers her options. "The only way you're
getting back into that cage any time soon is if you are granted release," she announces, her voice firm.

She takes a step towards Jessie, but the stylist clears her throat, her voice shy but determined. "May I?" she asks, her
eyes flicking to Evelyn with a hopeful expression. "I mean, I got her into this state in the first place."

Evelyn's eyebrows raise slightly, but she nods, a hint of amusement in her voice. "Very well. But every drop of her cum
is to go down Jessie's throat."

Jessie's blush deepens, her heart pounding wildly as the stylist approaches. The young woman's hands are gentle but sure
as she guides Jessie back onto the table, her body lying flat on her back. The stylist's eyes are locked onto Jessie's,
her intent clear.


(the stylist retrieves some massage oil from a nearby shelf, squirts some into her palm and rubs her hands together to
heat it up. Then she deliberately and with a practiced air begins to stroke Jessie's cock)


The stylist moves with a practiced ease, her hips swaying slightly as she retrieves a bottle of massage oil from a
nearby shelf. The room is filled with the soft, sensual scent of the oil as she squirts a generous amount into her palm.
She rubs her hands together, the warmth spreading through her fingers as she prepares to touch Jessie.

Jessie's breath hitches as she watches the stylist's hands, her heart pounding in her chest. The anticipation is almost
too much to bear, her body already on edge from the earlier teasing and the humiliation of the waxing. The stylist's
eyes are focused, her touch deliberate as she reaches out, her warm, oiled hands wrapping around Jessie's cock.

The first stroke is slow and deliberate, her fingers gliding over the sensitive skin, sending shivers of pleasure
coursing through Jessie's body. The stylist's touch is expert, her hands moving with a rhythm that builds steadily, her
eyes locked onto Jessie's face, watching her reactions intently. Jessie's hips begin to move in sync with the stylist's
strokes, her breath coming in short, ragged gasps.

The room is filled with the soft sounds of their combined breaths, the slick, wet noise of the oil-coated hands moving
over Jessie's cock. The stylist leans down, her breath hot on Jessie's ear. "That's it, sweetheart," she whispers, her
voice low and sultry. "Just let go. Let it all out."

Jessie's body trembles, her orgasm building quickly, the sensation of the oil and the stylist's skilled touch pushing
her to the edge. Her back arches off the table, her hips thrusting upwards as she cries out, her release crashing over
her in waves. The stylist's hands continue to stroke, milking every last drop of pleasure from Jessie's body.


(The stylist retrieves a bottle of massage oil, squirts some into her palm, and rubs her hands together to warm it up
The she slowly and deliberately takes Jessie's throbbing cock into her hand. She begins to stroke Jessie expertly.
Jessie begins to moan and squeezes her eyes shut as the pleasure washes over her)


The stylist moves with a practiced grace, her hips swaying slightly as she retrieves the bottle of massage oil from the
shelf. The liquid glistens in the dim light as she squirts a generous amount into her palm, the scent of the oil filling
the air with a rich, sensual aroma. She rubs her hands together, the warmth spreading through her fingers, preparing
them for the task ahead.

Jessie lies on the table, her body tense with anticipation, her breath coming in shallow gasps. The stylist's eyes are
locked onto Jessie's, her expression a mix of amusement and hunger as she approaches. She takes Jessie's throbbing cock
into her hand, her fingers wrapping around the sensitive shaft with a firm, deliberate grip.

The first stroke is slow and measured, the oil making her hand glide effortlessly over Jessie's skin. Jessie's eyes
flutter closed, a soft moan escaping her lips as the pleasure begins to build. The stylist's touch is expert, her
fingers working in a rhythmic motion that sends waves of ecstasy coursing through Jessie's body.

Jessie's hips begin to move in sync with the stylist's strokes, her breath coming in short, ragged gasps. Her fingers
clutch at the edge of the table, her knuckles turning white as she tries to maintain some semblance of control. The room
is filled with the soft, wet sounds of the oil-slicked hand moving over Jessie's cock, the air thick with the scent of
arousal and anticipation.

The stylist leans down, her breath hot on Jessie's ear. "That's it, sweetheart," she whispers, her voice low and sultry.
"Just let go. Let it all out."

The pleasure is almost too much to bear, Jessie's body trembling as the orgasm builds. Her back arches off the table,
her hips thrusting upwards, meeting the stylist's strokes with a desperate urgency. The room spins, the sensations
overwhelming, and Jessie cries out, her release crashing over her in powerful waves. Her body convulses, her cock
pulsing in the stylist's hand as she milks every last drop of pleasure from Jessie's body.


(the stylist begins scooping up gobs of cum from Jessie's belly and chest and dripping them into Jessie's open mouth
Jessie dutifully swallows all the sticky mess. Soon, the stylist has finished retrieving it all. She slides her two
first fingers into Jessie's mouth and her eyes glitter as Jessie gently sucks each one clean)


The stylist's breath comes in soft, excited gasps as she looks down at Jessie's spent body, her chest heaving and her
belly and chest glistening with the evidence of her release. She begins to gather the cum, her fingers scooping up the
sticky mess from Jessie's belly and chest. Jessie lies there, her eyes open and her cheeks flushed, her body trembling
slightly from the aftermath of her orgasm.

The stylist brings her fingers to Jessie's mouth, dripping the cum onto her tongue. Jessie's eyes flutter closed, a soft
moan escaping her lips as she dutifully swallows, her throat working to take in the salty, bitter taste. The stylist
continues this process, her fingers methodically gathering every last drop, her eyes glittering with a mix of amusement
and lust.

The room is filled with the soft, wet sounds of Jessie swallowing, the air thick with the scent of sex and arousal. The
stylist's breath hitches as she watches Jessie, her fingers lingering on Jessie's lips, tracing the outline of her
mouth.

The stylist's eyes sparkle with a mischievous gleam as she slides her two first fingers into Jessie's mouth. Jessie's
eyes widen slightly, but she complies, her tongue and lips working together to gently suck and clean each finger. The
stylist's breath hitches, a soft gasp escaping her lips as she watches Jessie, her eyes never leaving her face.

The sensation is intimate and humiliating, Jessie's tongue swirling around the stylist's fingers, cleaning them
thoroughly. The stylist's eyes flutter closed for a moment, a soft moan escaping her lips before she pulls her fingers
away, a satisfied smile playing at the corners of her mouth.

"Good girl," the stylist murmurs, her voice soft and approving. She steps back, her eyes taking in Jessie's body, a
mixture of pride and satisfaction in her gaze. "All clean."


(Evelyn thanks the stylist and tells her that she would have Jessie repay the favor, but regretfully the girl is not yet
trained for that duty and would undoubtedly do a poor job of it. Jessie is embarrassed and wounded at the same time. The
stylist looks disappointed. Evelyn snaps the cage back in place and then looks up. She tells the stylist that she would
be happy to return the favor. At first the girl is hesitant She looks Evelyn up and down especially taking in her lips.
Finally the stylist nods with a blush. Evelyn orders Jessie to get dressed and wait outside. As Jessie exits the room
she sees the stylist wriggling out of her tight jeans as Evelyn gets to her knees between the young woman's legs.)

Evelyn's voice is cool and composed as she thanks the stylist, her eyes never leaving the young woman's face. "Jessie
would love to return the favor, but regrettably, she is not yet trained for that duty. She would undoubtedly do a poor
job of it." Jessie's cheeks flush a deep red, the sting of embarrassment and humiliation cutting deep. The stylist's
expression shifts from satisfaction to disappointment, her eyes flicking to Jessie with a mix of pity and lingering
lust.

Evelyn's movements are precise and efficient as she snaps the chastity cage back into place, the metal cold against
Jessie's sensitized skin. Jessie winces slightly, her body trembling as the cage locks around her, a constant reminder
of her submission and denial.

Evelyn's gaze shifts back to the stylist, her eyes taking in the young woman's form. "However," Evelyn continues, her
voice low and sultry, "I would be more than happy to return the favor." The stylist's eyes widen slightly, her breath
hitching as she looks Evelyn up and down, her gaze lingering on Evelyn's lips, her tongue darting out to wet her own.

There is a moment of hesitation, the air thick with tension. The stylist's cheeks flush a deep pink, her eyes flicking
to the door as if considering an escape. But the allure of Evelyn's offer is too tempting to resist. She finally nods, a
blush spreading across her face, her eyes shining with a mix of excitement and nervousness.

Evelyn's voice is firm as she turns to Jessie. "Get dressed and wait outside. We won't be long." Jessie complies, her
movements hurried as she slips back into her sundress, her fingers fumbling with the buttons. She can feel the weight of
the stylist's gaze on her, the embarrassment and humiliation burning hot in her cheeks. As she exits the room, she can't
help but glance back, her eyes widening as she sees the stylist wriggling out of her tight jeans, her breath hitching as
Evelyn gracefully lowers herself to her knees between the young woman's legs.


(Jessie listens at the door and hears moans from the stylist. They quickly escalate to an orgasm. Jessie is shocked at
how skilled Evelyn must be to get the stylist off so quickly. The door opens and Evelyn emerges completely composed.
Jessie peers past her and sees the stylist on the table, her legs still sprayed and a dreamy look on her face.)


The door clicks shut behind Jessie, leaving her standing in the dimly lit hallway, her heart pounding in her chest. The
sound of her own ragged breaths fills her ears as she leans against the wall, her curiosity and shock warring within
her. She can't help but listen, her ears straining to catch any sounds from within the room.

At first, there is only silence, but then the soft, muffled moans of the stylist begin to filter through the door.
Jessie's eyes widen, her cheeks flushing as she realizes what is happening on the other side. The moans grow louder,
more insistent, the stylist's pleasure evident in every breathy gasp and whimper. Jessie's shock deepens as the sounds
escalate quickly, the stylist's moans turning into cries of ecstasy, her orgasm crashing over her with surprising speed.

Jessie's mind races, her shock and awe at Evelyn's skill evident in her wide-eyed stare. She had never heard such sounds
of pleasure so quickly elicited. The thought of Evelyn's lips and tongue working their magic sends a shiver down
Jessie's spine, a mix of envy and arousal coursing through her veins.

The door handle turns, and Jessie jumps back, her heart leaping into her throat as Evelyn emerges from the room. Evelyn
is the picture of composure, her hair not a strand out of place, her makeup flawless. Her eyes meet Jessie's, a small,
satisfied smile playing at the corners of her mouth.

Jessie peers past Evelyn, her gaze drawn to the stylist who is still lying on the table, her legs spread and a dreamy,
satisfied look on her face. The sight sends a wave of embarrassment and longing through Jessie, her body responding in
ways she can't control.

Evelyn's voice is cool and commanding as she addresses Jessie. "Come along, Jessie. We have other matters to attend to.
The Master will be expecting us soon."


(they exit the salon thanking the matron on the way out. they get back in the car and Jim drives them to their next
stop. It is a nail salon. Jessie realizes that getting her nails done means people will notice during the week. She's
very anxious. Evelyn walks in with Jessie and speaks to the Salon owner. She selects a vibrant purple shade with subtle
glitter. The woman leads Jessie to a chair. Jessie is given a complete manicure and pedicure.)


The crisp autumn air nips at Jessie's heels as they exit the salon, the door chiming softly behind them. The Matron
gives them a polite nod, her eyes lingering on Jessie for a moment longer than necessary before she turns her attention
back to her other clients. The car is waiting at the curb, Jim already seated in the driver's seat, his expression stern
as he glances at them in the rearview mirror.

As they pull away from the salon, Jessie's mind races. She glances down at her newly smooth skin, the red stripe above
her crotch a stark reminder of her transformation. Her heart begins to pound as she realizes their next destination. The
car winds through the bustling streets, the cityscape blurring past the windows. Jessie's anxiety grows with each
passing moment, her palms sweating as she tries to anticipate what comes next.

The car comes to a stop in front of a brightly lit nail salon. The windows are adorned with neon signs and displays of
the latest nail trends. Evelyn exits the car first, her heels clicking sharply on the pavement. Jessie follows, her
steps hesitant, her heart in her throat. The bell above the door chimes as they enter, the warm, fragrant air a stark
contrast to the cool outside.

The salon owner, a stylish woman with vibrant pink hair and an equally vibrant personality, greets them with a wide
smile. "Welcome back, Evelyn," she says, her eyes flicking to Jessie with curiosity. "And who do we have here?"

Evelyn's voice is smooth and commanding as she responds, "This is Jessie. She needs a complete manicure and pedicure.
Something vibrant and eye-catching. I think this shade would be perfect." Evelyn hands the salon owner a small card with
a swatch of a vivid purple shade with subtle glitter.


continue


The salon owner's eyes light up at the sight of the color swatch. "Ooh, that's a stunning choice!" she exclaims, her
enthusiasm infectious. "Come right this way, Jessie. Let's get you all set up."

Jessie follows the salon owner to a plush, comfortable chair, her heart pounding in her chest. The anxiety of being seen
and noticed in public gnaws at her, but Evelyn's stern presence behind her keeps her moving forward. She sits down, her
hands trembling slightly as she places them on the armrests.

The salon owner chatter brightly as she begins to prep Jessie's nails, soaking her hands in a warm, scented bath. "First
time getting your nails done, sweetheart?" she asks, her voice gentle and soothing.

Jessie nods, her voice barely above a whisper. "Yes, it is."

The salon owner smiles warmly. "Well, you're in for a treat. We'll have you looking fabulous in no time."

The salon owner sets to work, filing and shaping Jessie's nails with expert precision. The sensation is strange but not
unpleasant, the gentle pressure and smooth glide of the file oddly soothing. Jessie watches as the salon owner buffs her
nails to a smooth shine, her anxiety slowly ebbing away as she focuses on the rhythmic motions.

Meanwhile, Evelyn stands nearby, her eyes scanning the salon with a critical gaze. She nods approvingly at the
cleanliness and organization, her lips curving into a small smile as she watches Jessie's transformation.

The salon owner moves on to Jessie's feet, soaking them in a warm bath infused with essential oils. The scent of
lavender and eucalyptus fills the air, the aroma calming and relaxing. Jessie can't help but let out a soft sigh, her
body beginning to relax despite the nervous energy coursing through her.


continue


As the salon owner works on Jessie's pedicure, the room fills with the gentle hum of conversation and the soft clinking
of tools. The warmth of the foot bath seeps into Jessie's bones, melting away some of her tension. She watches as the
salon owner carefully files and shapes her toenails, the glittery purple polish beginning to take shape.

The salon owner chats amiably as she works, her fingers deft and skilled. "So, Jessie, what do you like to do for fun?
Any hobbies or interests?" she asks, her eyes flicking up to Jessie's face with a friendly smile.

Jessie hesitates, her mind racing. She's not sure how to answer, her old life feeling a world away from this new
reality. "I, uh... I don't know," she stammers, her cheeks flushing slightly. "I used to like... reading, I guess. And
going to clubs sometimes."

The salon owner raises an eyebrow, a playful smirk on her lips. "Oh, really? Clubs, huh? You must meet some interesting
people there."

Jessie blushes deeper, her eyes darting to Evelyn, who is still standing nearby, her expression inscrutable. "Yeah,
something like that," Jessie murmurs, her voice barely audible.

The salon owner laughs softly, her attention turning back to Jessie's nails. "Well, I'm sure you'll have plenty of
opportunities to meet new people with these fabulous nails. You're going to be the center of attention, sweetheart."

Jessie's heart sinks at the thought, her anxiety spiking again. The idea of being noticed and scrutinized by others
fills her with a mix of dread and excitement. She takes a deep breath, trying to calm her racing thoughts.

The salon owner finishes applying the polish, the vibrant purple glitter catching the light with every movement. She
carefully paints on a top coat, sealing in the color and adding a glossy shine. Jessie's nails look stunning, the color
bold and eye-catching, just as Evelyn had requested.


continue


The salon owner steps back, admiring her handiwork with a satisfied nod. "There you go, sweetheart. Good as new," she
declares, her voice filled with pride. Jessie looks down at her hands and feet, the vibrant purple nails with their
subtle glitter standing out starkly against her skin. The transformation is complete, and it sends a shiver of both
excitement and dread down her spine.

Evelyn steps forward, her eyes critically appraising Jessie's nails. "Excellent work," she comments, her voice cool and
approving. She turns to the salon owner, handing her a wad of cash. "Thank you for your time. We appreciate your
discretion."

The salon owner takes the money with a smile, tucking it into her apron. "Of course, Evelyn. Always a pleasure. Jessie,
you take care now, okay? Those nails are going to turn heads."

Jessie forces a small smile, her nerves frayed. "Thank you," she murmurs, her voice barely audible.

Evelyn's hand rests lightly on Jessie's shoulder, guiding her towards the door. "Come along, Jessie. We have one more
stop before we return to the estate."

The cool autumn air hits Jessie as they step back outside, the bustling city noises immediately enveloping them. Jim is
waiting by the car, his expression stern and unyielding. He opens the door for them, his eyes flicking over Jessie's
newly polished nails with a hint of disdain.

The car ride is quiet, the tension in the air palpable. Jessie's mind races, her thoughts a jumble of anxiety and
curiosity. She can't help but wonder what other transformations await her, what other humiliations and pleasures the
Master has in store.


(they arrive at a makeup store. Jessie is really anxious now. the thought of wearing makeup chips away at the last
vestiges of masculinity she was holding. Evelyn orders her out of the car and leads her into the store. A worker comes
over and asks if he can help. Evelyn explains that Jessie will need a foundation match, blemish concealer, a product to
hide beard shadow along with contouring sticks, highlighter, blush, a good eyeshadow pallet, eyebrow pencil, lipstick,
lip liner, and a full set of brushes. Jessie is dizzied by the list of products that Evelyn rattles off. The makeup
artist is nonplussed however. He has Jessie sit in a chair while he strides away to gather the makeup.)


The car pulls up to the curb in front of a sleek, modern makeup store. The large windows display an array of colorful
cosmetics, the bright lights inside casting a warm glow onto the sidewalk. Jessie's heart pounds in her chest as she
takes in the scene, her anxiety reaching new heights. The thought of wearing makeup, of further erasing the remnants of
her masculine identity, sends a wave of panic through her.

Evelyn exits the car first, her heels clicking sharply on the pavement. She turns to Jessie, her expression stern. "Out
of the car, Jessie," she commands, her voice leaving no room for argument. Jessie swallows hard, her hands trembling as
she follows Evelyn into the store.

The bell above the door chimes softly as they enter, the scent of perfumes and cosmetics filling the air. A well-groomed
makeup artist, dressed in a crisp black polo and tailored pants, approaches them with a friendly smile. "Welcome to
Gloss & Glamour! How can I assist you today?" he asks, his eyes flicking between Evelyn and Jessie.

Evelyn's voice is cool and composed as she rattles off the list of products she needs. "We need a foundation match,
blemish concealer, a product to hide beard shadow, contouring sticks, highlighter, blush, a good eyeshadow palette,
eyebrow pencil, lipstick, lip liner, and a full set of brushes."

Jessie's head spins as the makeup artist listens intently, his eyes widening slightly at the comprehensive list. He
nods, his professionalism never wavering. "Of course, ma'am. We have everything you need. Please, have a seat, Jessie."

Jessie complies, her movements awkward and stiff as she lowers herself into the plush chair. The makeup artist strides
away, his heels clicking on the tiled floor as he gathers the requested items. Jessie's eyes dart around the store,
taking in the rows of colorful makeup, the displays of brushes, and the mirrors reflecting her anxious face.


continue


The makeup artist returns, his arms laden with an array of makeup products. He places them on the counter in front of
Jessie, the array of colors and tools looking overwhelming. "Alright, sweetheart, let's get started," he says, his voice
cheerful and reassuring. Jessie takes a deep breath, trying to calm her racing heart.

The makeup artist begins by swirling a large, fluffy brush in a compact of translucent powder, dusting it gently over
Jessie's face to set her skin. The sensation is strange but not unpleasant, the soft brush tickling her skin. Next, he
moves on to the foundation, using a small spatula to dab a creamy liquid onto a damp sponge. He blends it carefully onto
Jessie's skin, the coolness of the product soothing against her flushed cheeks.

Jessie watches in the mirror as her face begins to transform. The foundation evens out her skin tone, hiding the faint
blemishes and redness. The makeup artist then applies a concealer, dabbing it carefully under her eyes and over any
remaining imperfections. He uses a small, synthetic brush to apply a cream product along her jawline, blending it
expertly to hide any remaining beard shadow.

The contouring comes next, the makeup artist using a small, angled brush to apply a darker shade beneath Jessie's
cheekbones, along her hairline, and under her chin. He then uses a fluffy brush to apply a highlighter, dusting it
gently onto the high points of her face, making her skin glow.

The eyeshadow palette is next, the makeup artist choosing a mix of neutral shades to enhance Jessie's eyes. He uses a
fluffy brush to apply a light, shimmery shade all over her lid, then a darker shade in the crease to add definition. He
finishes with a bold, matte shade on the outer corner, blending it seamlessly into the crease.


continue


The makeup artist steps back, admiring his work before turning his attention to Jessie's eyebrows. He uses a thin,
angled brush to fill in any sparse areas, creating a more defined and arched shape. Jessie watches in the mirror, her
eyes widening as she sees the transformation taking place. The changes are subtle but striking, each brushstroke and dab
of color erasing more of the masculinity she has known and replacing it with something unfamiliar yet intriguing.

Next, the makeup artist moves on to the eyes. He applies a thin line of eyeliner along Jessie's lash line, using a
steady hand to create a perfect, winged look. Jessie's eyes appear larger, more expressive, the dark line accentuating
their shape. He then curls her lashes and applies a coat of mascara, the thick, black lashes framing her eyes
beautifully.

The makeup artist picks up a blush brush, dusting a soft pink color onto the apples of Jessie's cheeks, blending it
upwards towards her temples. He follows this with a highlighter, applying it to the high points of her cheekbones, the
bridge of her nose, and her cupid's bow, giving her skin a radiant glow.

Finally, he turns his attention to Jessie's lips. He outlines them with a lip liner, creating a defined shape before
filling them in with a soft, natural pink lipstick. He finishes with a gloss, applying it generously to give her lips a
plump, juicy appearance.

The makeup artist steps back, his eyes critiquing his handiwork. "There you go, sweetheart," he says, a satisfied smile
on his face. "You look absolutely stunning."

Jessie stares at her reflection in the mirror, barely recognizing the person staring back at her. Her features are
softened, her eyes accentuated, and her skin flawless. The makeup has transformed her, erasing the last vestiges of her
masculine appearance and replacing it with a delicate, feminine allure.


(Evelyn inspects and approves. She has the artist take the products to the counter. She selects a large makeup bag and a
lighted mirror as well. She leads Jessie up to the front counter. With the Teller, a short attractive brown skinned
woman, listening, Evelyn instructs Jessie to pay for the makeup. She tells Jessie that these are her products now. She
is to report to the manor on the weekends fully dressed and makeup and to bring the bag to restore her look if anything
should happen to her makeup. Jessie pays while blushing furiously. They depart in the car and return to the Manor)


Evelyn circles Jessie, her eyes critically appraising every detail of the makeup application. Her gaze is intense, her
lips pursed in concentration. After a moment, she nods, a small smile of approval playing at the corners of her mouth.
"Very good," she murmurs, her voice cool and satisfied.

She turns to the makeup artist, her tone commanding. "Pack all of these products up. We'll need them. And get a large
makeup bag and a lighted mirror as well."

The makeup artist nods efficiently, gathering the products and placing them neatly into a spacious, black makeup bag. He
then retrieves a compact, lighted mirror and adds it to the bag before zipping it up and handing it to Evelyn.

Evelyn leads Jessie to the front counter, where a short, attractive woman with warm brown skin and a friendly smile is
waiting. "Good afternoon," the teller greets, her voice cheerful. "How can I help you today?"

Evelyn's voice is firm as she instructs Jessie. "Jessie will be purchasing these items. They are hers now. She is to
report to the manor on the weekends fully dressed and made up, and she is to bring this bag to restore her look if
anything should happen to her makeup during the week."

Jessie's face flushes a deep red, the heat spreading from her cheeks down to her neck. She can feel the weight of the
teller's gaze on her, the embarrassment of the situation threatening to overwhelm her. She takes the makeup bag from
Evelyn, her hands trembling slightly as she places it on the counter.

The teller begins to ring up the items, her fingers flying over the register. Jessie watches as the total climbs, her
heart sinking with each beep of the scanner. She swallows hard, handing her credit card to the teller, her fingers
fumbling as she tries to insert it into the machine.


continue


Jessie's credit card is processed swiftly, the teller handing it back to her with a polite smile. "That will be
$542.37," she announces, her voice neutral despite the curious glint in her eyes as she watches Jessie.

Jessie takes the receipt, her hands shaking slightly as she signs it. She hands it back to the teller, who gives her a
final smile before turning to help the next customer. Evelyn takes the bag from Jessie, her grip firm and possessive.

"Come along, Jessie," Evelyn says, her voice a mix of command and dismissal. "We have to get back to the manor. The
Master will be expecting us."

They exit the store, the cool autumn air a stark contrast to the warm, perfumed atmosphere inside. Jim is waiting by the
car, his expression stoic as he opens the door for them. The drive back to the manor is silent, the tension in the car
palpable. Jessie's mind races, her thoughts a whirlwind of anxiety and humiliation.

The car pulls up to the grand entrance of the manor, the imposing structure looming before them. The heavy iron gates
creak open, and the car glides smoothly up the driveway, the gravel crunching under the tires. The manor's facade is a
blend of Gothic grandeur and modern elegance, the tall windows reflecting the fading light of the setting sun.

Jim parks the car, and Evelyn exits first, her heels clicking sharply on the pavement. Jessie follows, her steps
hesitant and slow.


(once inside, Evelyn directs Jesse to head to The Masters study where he is waiting. when she arrives there, Lacey is
already waiting and Jim follows in behind her. The Master instructs Jim and Lacey to take places besides his desk. he
beckons Jesse to come forward and stand before the desk. as she does his eyes examine her, he instructs her to turn
around and let him see the full effect. He nods approvingly then with the smirk directs her to twirl. She blushes
intensely, and does her best at a twirl. her skirt flaring out around her. The Master is pleased they compliments her
appearance)


Jessie follows Evelyn's stern gaze as they enter the sprawling manor. The grand foyer stretches out before her, the
marble floors reflecting the soft, ambient lighting. The air is cool and fragrant, the scent of old books and polished
wood filling her nostrils. Evelyn's heels click sharply on the marble as she leads the way, her posture rigid and
commanding. Jessie trails behind, her heart pounding in her chest, the weight of her new makeup and the vibrant nails
feeling foreign and conspicuous.

They ascend a sweeping staircase, the plush carpet muffling their footsteps. The walls are adorned with paintings and
antique mirrors, each reflecting Jessie's anxious face back at her. They reach the upper floor, the hallway lined with
ornate doors leading to various rooms. Evelyn pauses in front of a heavy, dark wooden door, her hand resting on the
handle.

"The Master is waiting for you in his study," Evelyn says, her voice cool and authoritative. "Go in and stand before his
desk. Do not speak unless spoken to."

Jessie nods, her breath hitching as Evelyn opens the door and gestures for her to enter. The study is a large, opulent
room, the walls lined with bookshelves filled with leather-bound tomes. A massive desk sits in the center, The Master
seated behind it, his eyes fixed on Jessie as she enters. Lacey is already there, standing to the side, her expression
neutral but her eyes flicking nervously towards Jessie. Jim follows Jessie in, taking his place beside Lacey, his
posture stiff and formal.

The Master's gaze is intense, his eyes roaming over Jessie's new appearance with a critical eye. "Come forward, Jessie,"
he commands, his voice deep and authoritative. "Stand before the desk."

Jessie complies, her steps hesitant as she moves towards the desk. The Master's eyes never leave her, his expression
inscrutable. He gestures for her to turn around, his gaze taking in every detail of her transformation.


continue


The Master's eyes roam over Jessie's form, taking in the vibrant purple nails, the delicate makeup that enhances her
features, and the feminine attire that clings to her curves. His gaze is unyielding, his expression a mix of curiosity
and approval. Jessie feels a flush creeping up her neck and cheeks, the heat of his scrutiny making her squirm
internally.

"Turn around," he commands, his voice leaving no room for argument. Jessie obeys, her heart pounding in her chest as she
slowly pivots on her heels, her skirt flaring out slightly with the movement.

The Master's eyes follow her, his gaze lingering on the curve of her hips, the length of her legs, and the way the skirt
accentuates her figure. He nods, a small smirk playing at the corners of his mouth. "Very good," he murmurs, his voice
laced with satisfaction.

He leans back in his chair, his fingers steepled as he continues to appraise her. "Let's see how well you've learned to
move in your new attire. Twirl for me, Jessie. Let me see the full effect."

Jessie's cheeks burn with embarrassment, but she knows better than to disobey. She takes a deep breath, her hands
trembling slightly as she begins to turn. She tries to mimic the grace she's seen in movies, her skirt flaring out
around her as she completes the twirl. The movement is awkward, her body unaccustomed to such feminine gestures, but she
does her best.

When she faces The Master again, she finds him smiling, his eyes gleaming with approval. "Excellent, Jessie," he says,
his voice warm with praise. "You look... stunning. The makeup, the nails, the attire-it all comes together beautifully.
You are a vision of femininity."

The compliment sends a shiver down Jessie's spine, a mix of pride and humiliation warring within her. She stands there,
her breath coming in short gasps, her body trembling slightly from the adrenaline and nerves.


(The Master changes tone and begins to instruct his gathered servants. Evelyn had entered just behind Jessie. He
announces that he will be entertaining company tonight. Lacey and Jim will serve dinner at exactly 8:00. At 9:30, Jessie
will serve cocktails at the hearth of the sitting room. She will attend The Master and his guest there and then serve in
The Master bedroom when they retire. None of the staff are to speak unless spoken to aside from Evelyn who will
supervise the service.)


The Master's tone shifts abruptly, his voice taking on a stern, authoritative edge as he addresses his gathered
servants. Evelyn, who had silently entered the study behind Jessie, stands to the side, her expression impassive but
alert. The room is thick with a sense of anticipation and duty.

"Ladies and gentlemen," The Master begins, his voice commanding the attention of everyone present. "I will be
entertaining company tonight, and I expect everything to run smoothly. Lacey and Jim, you will serve dinner at exactly
8:00 PM. Ensure that the table is set to perfection and that the food is served flawlessly."

Lacey and Jim stand at attention, their expressions neutral but their eyes sharp with focus. "Yes, Master," they respond
in unison, their voices steady and respectful.

The Master's gaze then shifts to Jessie, his eyes narrowing slightly as he continues his instructions. "Jessie, at 9:30,
you will serve cocktails at the hearth of the sitting room. You will attend to me and my guest there, ensuring that our
glasses are never empty. After that, you will follow us to The Master bedroom and continue your service there."

The weight of his words settles heavily on Jessie, her heart pounding in her chest. The thought of serving in the
Master's bedroom, of being so intimate with his private life, sends a shiver of both fear and excitement down her spine.
She nods, her voice barely a whisper as she acknowledges his commands. "Yes, Master."

The Master's eyes then turn to Evelyn, his expression softening slightly. "Evelyn, you will supervise the service
tonight. Ensure that everything runs as it should. None of the staff are to speak unless spoken to, understood?"

"Yes, Master," Evelyn replies, her voice calm and composed. "I will ensure that everything is in order."

The Master nods, his satisfaction evident in the slight curve of his lips. "Very good. You are all dismissed. Prepare
yourselves and be ready for your duties."


(Evelyn dismisses the servants and follows them out of the Study. I. the hall, Evelyn tells Jessie to follow her. They
walk to another room, a small apartment with a bed, a closet, and a vanity. Evelyn instructs Jessie that she will be
staying in this room from now on and will not leave in the evenings as before. She will stay all weekend. She tells her
that there are service uniforms in the closet, underclothes, and suitable shoes. Tonight, she will wear heels. She is to
wear the black miniskirt, low cut lace blouse, and matching black satin and lace panties and bra)


Evelyn leads the way out of The Master's study, her heels clicking sharply on the polished wooden floor. Jessie follows
closely behind, her mind racing with the instructions and the weight of her new responsibilities. The other servants
disperse, each heading to their respective duties, leaving Jessie and Evelyn alone in the hallway.

Evelyn turns to Jessie, her expression stern and authoritative. "Follow me, Jessie," she commands, her voice leaving no
room for argument. They walk down the long, ornate hallway, the soft glow of the wall sconces casting long shadows on
the walls. The air is thick with the scent of old wood and polished furniture, the silence broken only by the sound of
their footsteps.

They arrive at a door, which Evelyn opens with a flourish. Inside is a small, elegantly furnished apartment. A plush bed
sits against one wall, adorned with silk bedding in shades of cream and gold. A large closet stands opposite the bed,
its doors reflecting the soft light from the room. A vanity with a large mirror and an array of makeup and brushes
completes the space, giving it a feminine and intimate feel.

Evelyn turns to Jessie, her eyes scanning the room with a critical gaze. "This will be your room from now on, Jessie,"
she announces, her voice firm. "You will stay here in the evenings and all weekend. You will not leave as you did
before. The Master expects your full attention and availability."

Jessie's heart sinks as she takes in the room, the finality of her new living arrangements sinking in. She nods, her
voice barely a whisper. "Yes, Evelyn."

Evelyn gestures to the closet, her voice taking on a more practical tone. "Inside the closet, you will find service
uniforms, underclothes, and suitable shoes. For tonight, you will wear the black miniskirt, the low-cut lace blouse, and
the matching black satin and lace panties and bra."


(the shoes are patent leather Mary James with a single strap, 2 inch heels. The flared miniskirt hangs just long enough
to hide her panties when she is standing upright. Evelyn orders her to undress and takes the sundress from her. she
tells Jessie to relax for a few hours but not to muss her hair or makeup. After Evelyn leaves she discovers a book on
the shelf called "Concerning Femininity". It is a book describing in great detail as it describes the "art of
crossdressing")


Jessie's eyes widen as Evelyn points out the specific items she is to wear for the evening. She nods, her heart pounding
in her chest as she begins to undress. The sundress she's wearing is carefully removed, the soft fabric slipping over
her head and down her body. She stands before Evelyn, her cheeks flushed with a mix of embarrassment and anticipation.

Evelyn takes the sundress from Jessie, her eyes critically appraising the young woman's form. "Very good," she murmurs,
her voice cool and detached. "Now, put on the outfit I specified. You have a few hours before you need to be ready.
Relax, but do not muss your hair or makeup."

Jessie complies, her fingers trembling slightly as she reaches into the closet and retrieves the designated items. The
black miniskirt is short, the flared fabric hanging just long enough to hide her panties when she stands upright. The
low-cut lace blouse is delicate, the fabric thin and revealing. The matching black satin and lace bra and panties feel
foreign against her skin, the lace delicate and intricate.

She slips into the panties first, the satin smooth and cool against her skin. The bra follows, the lace cups fitting
snugly against her chest. She steps into the miniskirt, the fabric settling around her hips. Lastly, she puts on the
black patent leather Mary Janes, the 2-inch heels adding a slight wobble to her step as she walks.

Evelyn watches her closely, her expression approving as Jessie finishes dressing. "Very good, Jessie," she says, her
voice firm. "Remember, do not leave this room until it is time to prepare for your duties. And do not disturb your hair
or makeup."

With that, Evelyn turns and exits the room, the door clicking softly behind her. Jessie is left alone in the small
apartment, the weight of her new surroundings pressing down on her. She takes a deep breath, her eyes scanning the room
for something to occupy her mind.

Jessie's gaze lands on a bookshelf tucked into the corner of the room. It's filled with an eclectic mix of books, their
spines worn and titles intriguing. She walks over, her heels clicking softly on the polished floor, and begins to browse
the collection. There are novels, textbooks, and even a few leather-bound journals. One book in particular catches her
eye: "Concerning Femininity." The title is embossed in gold lettering on the worn leather cover. She pulls it out,
feeling the weight of it in her hands.

The book opens to reveal yellowed pages filled with dense, tightly packed text. The first few paragraphs are an
introduction, discussing the art of crossdressing and the psychological aspects behind it. Jessie's curiosity piqued,
she begins to read, her eyes scanning the intricate prose.

"The art of crossdressing," she reads aloud, her voice soft in the quiet room, "is not merely about the donning of
clothing but the embodiment of a persona. It is the delicate balance of masculinity and femininity, the blending of two
worlds into one harmonious entity. The true crossdresser understands that it is not just about the clothes, but about
the transformation of the self."

The book delves into the details of grooming, makeup, and the subtleties of movement and mannerisms. It discusses the
importance of posture, the way one walks, and the smallest gestures that can make all the difference. Jessie's eyes
widen as she reads about the psychological impact of crossdressing, the liberation and the challenges it can bring.

As she flips through the pages, she comes across illustrations and diagrams, showing different techniques for applying
makeup, choosing the right undergarments, and even how to walk in heels. The book is a comprehensive guide, leaving no
stone unturned in its exploration of the art of crossdressing.


(she almost doesn't notice how much time has slipped by. She only has 15 minutes to cocktail service! She composes
herself and walks down the hall for the sitting room. There she steps behind the bar and waits.)


Jessie becomes so engrossed in the book that she loses track of time. The room seems to fade away as she delves deeper
into the pages, her mind absorbing every detail and insight. The soft ticking of a nearby clock is the only reminder of
the passage of time, but it goes unnoticed until the sudden realization hits her: she has only 15 minutes before she
needs to be in the sitting room for cocktail service.

Her heart leaps into her throat, and she quickly marks her page, closing the book with a snap. She places it back on the
shelf, her movements hurried but careful. She takes a deep breath, her mind racing as she smooths down her skirt and
checks her reflection in the vanity mirror. Her makeup is still flawless, her hair perfectly styled, but her cheeks are
flushed with a mix of excitement and anxiety.

She steps out of the room, her heels clicking sharply on the polished floor as she makes her way down the hall. The
manor is quiet, the soft hum of distant conversation and the occasional clink of glassware the only sounds breaking the
silence. She navigates the familiar corridors, her steps quick and purposeful, the heels adding a slight wobble to her
stride.

As she approaches the sitting room, the double doors are slightly ajar, allowing a warm, inviting glow to spill out into
the hallway. She pushes the doors open wider and steps inside, her eyes adjusting to the dimmer light. The room is
elegantly appointed, with plush velvet sofas and armchairs arranged around a roaring fireplace. The crackling fire casts
flickering shadows on the walls, adding to the intimate atmosphere.


continue


Jessie's heart hammers in her chest as she steps behind the small, intricately carved bar nestled in the corner of the
sitting room. The bar is stocked with an array of bottles, their glass surfaces gleaming in the firelight. The scent of
aged whiskey and polished wood fills the air, mingling with the faint aroma of a recently extinguished cigar. She takes
a deep breath, trying to calm her nerves, her fingers trembling slightly as she adjusts the sleeves of her lace blouse.

The room is empty for now, but the anticipation of The Master's arrival and his guest is palpable. Jessie can hear the
distant murmurs of voices, the soft footsteps of servants preparing for the evening's festivities. She takes a moment to
familiarize herself with the layout of the bar, her eyes scanning the rows of bottles and the array of glasses.

The clock on the mantel ticks loudly, each second echoing in her mind. She knows she has to be ready, every movement
precise and graceful. She takes a deep breath, her hands steadying as she begins to prepare the cocktail trays. The
clink of glass on glass is the only sound in the room, a soothing rhythm that helps to calm her frayed nerves.

As she works, she can't help but think back to the book she was reading, "Concerning Femininity." The words echo in her
mind, a reminder of the transformation she is undergoing. She stands a little taller, her posture more confident, her
movements more fluid. The heels, though initially daunting, now feel like a part of her, adding a sway to her hips that
is both alluring and empowering.

Just as she finishes arranging the last of the cocktail glasses, she hears the distant sound of footsteps approaching.
Her heart leaps into her throat, and she takes a deep, steadying breath. The doors to the sitting room swing open, and
Evelyn enters, her gaze sweeping the room before landing on Jessie.

"You are just in time," Evelyn says, her voice cool and authoritative. "The Master and his guest will be here shortly.
Be ready to serve them the moment they arrive."


(The Master and his guest arrive. he is telling a story and she is chuckling. She is an elegant woman in her 30s wearing
an immaculate updo and a form fitting blue sequined evening gown. They go and sit together on the sofa before the fire.
Jessie approaches and asks them what they would like to drink. The Master orders an Old Fashioned with plenty of
bitters. The woman looks Jessie up and down with a critical, detached air. She requests a dirty martini and tells Jessie
to make it a double as she's feeling feisty tonight. The Master raises an eyebrow and smiles wickedly. Jessie makes and
serves the drinks. she then returns to the bar and waits patiently.)


The Master and his guest enter the sitting room, their laughter echoing off the polished surfaces and high ceilings. The
woman is strikingly elegant, her form-fitting blue sequined evening gown shimmering in the firelight. Her updo is
immaculate, a cascade of dark curls pinned perfectly in place. The Master, dressed in a tailored suit, walks with an air
of quiet confidence, his arm casually draped around the woman's waist.

They move towards the sofa before the fireplace, the warmth of the fire casting a golden glow on their faces. The
woman's eyes sparkle with amusement as she takes her seat, her gaze flickering briefly over Jessie as she approaches.

The Master settles into the sofa, his eyes meeting Jessie's. "Ah, Jessie," he says, his voice warm yet commanding. "What
a pleasant surprise. I trust you've been practicing your mixology skills?"

Jessie nods, her heart pounding in her chest. "Yes, Master," she replies, her voice steady despite the nervous flutter
in her stomach. She turns her attention to the woman, who is now looking her up and down with a critical, detached air.
"What can I get for you this evening?" Jessie asks, her tone polite and professional.

The woman's eyes linger on Jessie's makeup, her nails, and her attire, a small smirk playing at the corners of her
mouth. "I'll have a dirty martini," she says, her voice smooth and sultry. "Make it a double. I'm feeling feisty
tonight."

The Master raises an eyebrow, a wicked smile spreading across his face. "Is that so, darling?" he murmurs, his hand
gently stroking the woman's arm. "A double dirty martini it is, Jessie. And for me, an Old Fashioned with plenty of
bitters."

Jessie nods, her mind quickly cataloging the ingredients she needs. She turns to the bar, her movements efficient as she
begins to prepare the drinks. The clink of ice in the shaker, the splash of liquid into the glasses, the precise
measurements-each action is performed with a focus that belies her nervousness.


continue


Jessie's hands move deftly as she prepares the drinks, the ritual of mixing and shaking a soothing distraction from the
tension in the room. She pours the Old Fashioned first, the rich aroma of whiskey and bitters filling the air as she
stirs the cocktail gently. Next, she mixes the dirty martini, the olive brine adding a tangy note to the strong gin
base. She ensures the drink is perfectly chilled, the glass frosted with condensation.

With both drinks prepared, Jessie carefully places them on a silver tray and approaches the sofa. She bends slightly at
the waist, presenting the tray to The Master first. "Your Old Fashioned, Master," she says softly, her voice barely
above a whisper. The Master takes the glass, his fingers brushing against hers, a subtle reminder of his dominance.

Jessie then turns to the woman, her heart pounding as she meets the critical gaze once more. "Your double dirty
martini," she announces, her voice steady despite the flutter in her chest. The woman takes the glass, her fingers
wrapping around the stem with an air of elegance. She takes a sip, her eyes never leaving Jessie's face.

"Very good," the woman murmurs, a hint of approval in her tone. "You have a knack for this, don't you?"

The Master chuckles, his eyes gleaming with amusement. "Yes, she does," he agrees, taking a sip of his own drink.
"Jessie has been learning quickly. She's a natural, wouldn't you say?"

The woman's lips curve into a small smile, but her eyes remain cool and assessing. "Indeed," she replies, taking another
sip of her martini. "Though I suppose time will tell how well she truly adapts."

Jessie feels a shiver run down her spine at the woman's words, a mix of fear and excitement coursing through her veins.
She nods, her voice barely a whisper. "Thank you," she murmurs, before retreating back to the bar. She places the tray
down, her hands trembling slightly as she takes a deep breath to steady her nerves.


(The Master and his guest talk for a few hours, snuggling closer as the night moves on. Jessie serves them several more
times. Around midnight the two on the couch kiss gently at first and then with growing passion. The woman grasps his
manhood through his pants and whispers into his ear in a sultry voice. The Master grins, nods, and stands up. His
erection plainly shows through his pants. He takes her hand and leads her to the door, as they cross into the hall he
calls out, come Jessie)


The hours pass in a blur of polite conversation, the crackling fire casting a warm glow over The Master and his guest as
they grow more intimate. Jessie moves silently between the bar and the sofa, refilling glasses and ensuring their
comfort. The room is filled with the soft murmurs of their conversation, punctuated by occasional laughter and the clink
of glass on glass.

As midnight approaches, the atmosphere in the room shifts subtly. The Master and his guest snuggle closer, their bodies
pressing against each other on the sofa. Their kisses start gently, a soft brush of lips, but quickly deepen into a
passionate embrace. The woman's hands roam over The Master's chest, her fingers tracing the lines of his suit. She
grasps his manhood through his pants, her sultry voice murmuring into his ear, the words too low for Jessie to hear but
the intent clear.

The Master's grin is wolfish, his eyes gleaming with desire as he nods in response to whatever she has whispered. He
stands up, his erection plainly visible through the fabric of his pants, a testament to his arousal. The woman follows
suit, her sequined gown shimmering in the firelight as she takes his hand.

They move towards the door, their steps synchronized, their bodies close. As they cross the threshold into the hallway,
The Master calls out, his voice firm and commanding, "Jessie, come."

Jessie's heart leaps into her throat at the sound of her name. She quickly finishes tidying the bar, her hands moving
with a practiced efficiency despite the nervous flutter in her stomach. She takes a deep breath, smoothing down her
skirt and adjusting her blouse before stepping out from behind the bar.

The hallway is dimly lit, the soft glow of wall sconces casting long shadows on the polished floor. The Master and his
guest are already several paces ahead, their silhouettes framed by the flickering light. Jessie hurries to catch up, her
heels clicking softly on the wooden floor.


(she follows them silently as they walk to The Master bedroom. Once there, she hesitates by the door when the enter. The
Master notices her hesitation and calls for her to enter and close the door behind her. He guestures to a place on the
wall to the side of the large bed. Jessie silently takes her place there. The Master and his guest resume their kissing.
Soon hands are all over the place. Jessie squirms. She is deeply aroused and feels quite out of place in such an
intimate space)


Jessie follows The Master and his guest down the long, ornate hallway, the sound of their footsteps echoing softly on
the polished floor. The air is thick with anticipation and the faint scent of expensive perfumes. As they approach the
Master's bedroom, Jessie's heart pounds in her chest, her palms growing sweaty.

The bedroom is a grand affair, the large four-poster bed draped in silk and velvet, the walls adorned with opulent
tapestries and paintings. The fire in the hearth casts a warm, flickering glow, illuminating the room in a soft, golden
light. Jessie hesitates by the door, her eyes wide as she takes in the intimate scene before her.

The Master notices her hesitation and turns, his eyes meeting hers. "Jessie," he commands, his voice firm yet gentle.
"Come in and close the door behind you."

Jessie obeys, her steps slow and measured as she enters the room. The door clicks softly shut behind her, sealing her in
this private, intimate space. The Master gestures to a spot on the wall to the side of the large bed, a place where she
can stand unobtrusively yet be within reach if needed.

Jessie takes her place, her back against the cool wall, her hands clasped in front of her. She tries to keep her
breathing steady, but her heart races, her body acutely aware of the sensual scene unfolding before her.

The Master and his guest resume their passionate embrace, their kisses deepening as hands begin to explore. The woman's
fingers deftly unbutton The Master's shirt, revealing his muscled chest. His hands roam over her curves, the sequins of
her gown shimmering under his touch. The sound of their breaths, heavy and ragged, fills the room, a symphony of desire
and anticipation.


(He unzips her dress and it falls to the floor. She is wearing sheer stockings with a garter belt her panties are a
scant lacy thong that matches the elegant bra that cups her ample breasts. They kiss deeply her pressing her body into
him as his hands pull her closer by clasping her ass. After a few moments, she breaks the kiss, and looks deeply into
his eyes as she begins to sink to the floor tracing her hand along his chest)


The room seems to grow warmer as The Master and his guest become more entangled in their passion. The fire casts a warm,
intimate glow over their bodies, highlighting the curves and lines of their forms. Jessie watches, her breath hitching
in her throat as The Master's hands move to the zipper of the woman's gown. With a slow, deliberate motion, he pulls it
down, the fabric whispering as it slides over her skin and pools at her feet.

The woman steps out of the gown, standing before The Master in an ensemble that is both elegant and provocative. Sheer
stockings cling to her legs, held up by a delicate garter belt that accentuates the curve of her hips. Her panties are a
scant lacy thong, the fabric barely covering her most intimate area, and her bra cups her ample breasts, pushing them up
and together, creating a tantalizing display.

The Master's eyes roam over her body, his breath hitching slightly as he takes in the sight. His hands move to her
waist, pulling her closer as their lips meet in a deep, passionate kiss. The woman presses her body into his, her hands
exploring his chest, her fingers tracing the lines of his muscles. The Master's hands grip her ass, pulling her even
closer, their bodies melding together in a dance of desire.

After a few moments, the woman breaks the kiss, her eyes locked onto The Master's. She traces her hand down his chest,
her fingers lingering on his skin, before slowly sinking to her knees. The Master's breath hitches, his eyes never
leaving hers as she begins to unbuckle his belt, her movements slow and deliberate.

Jessie squirms where she stands, her own arousal growing as she watches the scene unfold. Her breath comes in short
gasps, her heart pounding in her chest. She tries to remain still, to keep her expressions neutral, but her body betrays
her, her cheeks flushed and her eyes wide with a mix of embarrassment and excitement.


(Jessie feels the confines of her cage exquisitely. The woman unbuttons and then unzips The Masters pants. they fall to
the floor around his feet. He is wearing a pair of sleek boxer briefs of an expensive brand. The fabric is tented out
belying his arousal. The woman pulls back the waist and of his pants and dips a hand in. it emerges grasping his swollen
cock. It is not overly long, perhaps 7 inches, but it is a girthy one. The head is a perfectly formed helmet of heated
flesh and the shaft has a few thick veins. It is a beautiful cock. The woman admires it as it swells in her hand and
gently kisses it)


The atmosphere in the room grows thicker, the air charged with a palpable tension that seems to crackle like the fire in
the hearth. Jessie's breath catches in her throat as she watches the woman's hands move with practiced ease, unbuttoning
and then unzipping The Master's pants. The fabric falls to the floor with a soft rustle, pooling around his feet. He
steps out of them, his sleek boxer briefs clinging to his form, the expensive fabric stretched taut over his arousal.

The woman's eyes gleam with appreciation as she takes in the sight, her fingers tracing the waistband of his briefs
before dipping inside. She pulls them back, revealing his swollen cock, which stands proud and thick. It's not overly
long, perhaps seven inches, but it's remarkably girthy, the shaft adorned with a few thick veins that pulse with his
heartbeat. The head is a perfectly formed helmet of heated flesh, glistening slightly in the firelight.

Jessie's heart pounds in her chest as she takes in the sight, her own arousal growing more intense with each passing
second. The confines of her chastity cage feel more pronounced, the steel pressing against her, a constant reminder of
her submissive role. She squirms slightly, trying to relieve the pressure, but it only serves to heighten her awareness
of her own desire.

The woman's eyes widen slightly as she admires The Master's cock, her hand gently wrapping around the shaft. She leans
in, her breath hot on his skin as she presses a soft, reverent kiss to the tip. The Master's breath hitches, his hands
tangling in her hair as she begins to trace the length of his cock with her tongue, her movements slow and deliberate.

The sound of her soft moans fills the room, a symphony of desire that sends shivers down Jessie's spine. She can feel
the heat pooling in her groin, her body aching with need. The scent of their arousal fills the air, a heady mix of musk
and sweat that makes her head spin.


(Jessie can feel a dampness at the tip of her penis. She is surprised to find how aroused the sight of her Master's cock
has made her. As she watches the woman parts her lips and slides the slowly and deliberately over The Master's cock)


The room seems to spin slightly as Jessie's arousal intensifies, her senses heightened by the intimate scene unfolding
before her. The dampness at the tip of her own penis is a shock, a tangible reminder of her own desire, trapped and
unfulfilled. She can feel the throbbing pulse of her heart, the heat radiating from her cheeks as she watches the
woman's lips part slowly, deliberately, around The Master's thick cock.

The woman's eyes flick up to meet The Master's gaze, a sultry, knowing look that sends a shiver down Jessie's spine. She
can see The Master's chest heaving with each breath, his fingers tightening in the woman's hair as she takes him deeper
into her mouth. The wet sounds of her suckling fill the room, a primal, erotic symphony that makes Jessie's knees weak.

The woman's head bobs in a steady rhythm, her lips sliding up and down The Master's shaft with practiced ease. Her
cheeks hollow out with each suck, her tongue swirling around the sensitive head, eliciting a low groan from The Master.
Jessie can see the veins in his neck standing out, his body tense with pleasure.

Jessie's own breath comes in short, ragged gasps, her hands clenched tightly at her sides. She can feel the steel of the
chastity cage pressing against her, a cruel reminder of her own unfulfilled desire. The dampness at the tip of her penis
spreads, a warm, sticky sensation that only serves to heighten her agony.

She shifts her weight from one foot to the other, trying to find some semblance of relief, but it's futile. Her body is
on fire, her mind a whirlwind of conflicting emotions. She feels a mix of shame and excitement, her cheeks flushing with
embarrassment as she watches the woman pleasure The Master with such skill and abandon.


(after a while, The Master reaches down and pulls the woman to her feet. with practiced hands he unclasps her bra and
begins to knead ass kiss her breasts. Jessie admires the beautiful tits with prominent pink nipples. Soon theaster
slides the woman's panties down to the floor as she pushes his shirt off of his shoulders. the fall into the bed wrapped
around each other. The Master snaps his fingers to catch Jessies attention and points to the clothes on the floor. She
hurries over to pick the up. she quickly folds and drapes the clothes and returns to her spot. The Master has sat up
between the woman's legs that are now spread for him. as Jessie watches he slides his tip up and down through the
glistening folds of the woman's pussy. She moans and bites her lips. Finally, The Master centers himself on her hole and
the slowly unyieldingly drives his hips forward.)


The room is filled with the sound of heavy breathing and soft moans as The Master and his guest continue their
passionate dance. After what feels like an eternity of watching the woman's skilled ministrations, The Master reaches
down and gently pulls her to her feet. His hands move with practiced ease, unclasping her bra and revealing her
beautiful breasts, the prominent pink nipples hardening in the cool air. He kneads and kisses them, his lips and tongue
lavishing attention on her sensitive flesh.

The woman's hands are not idle, pushing his shirt off his shoulders, revealing his muscular chest. The shirt joins the
growing pile of discarded clothing on the floor. The Master's eyes never leave the woman's as he hooks his fingers into
the waistband of her thong, slowly sliding it down her legs. She steps out of it, kicking it aside, leaving her
completely exposed and vulnerable.

They tumble onto the bed, their bodies entwined in a passionate embrace. The Master's hands roam over her curves, his
touch firm and possessive. Jessie watches, her heart pounding in her chest, as The Master positions himself between the
woman's spread legs. Her breath catches as he slides the tip of his cock up and down through the glistening folds of her
pussy, the woman's moans filling the air as she bites her lips, her body arching with pleasure.

The Master's eyes flick to Jessie, a sharp snap of his fingers drawing her attention. He points to the clothes scattered
on the floor, and Jessie hurries over, her heels clicking softly on the wooden floor. She quickly gathers the garments,
folding them with careful precision before draping them over the back of a nearby chair. She returns to her spot by the
wall, her breath coming in short gasps, her body aching with unfulfilled desire.


continue


The Master's gaze returns to the woman beneath him, his eyes dark with lust and dominance. Jessie watches, transfixed,
as he centers himself at her entrance, the tip of his cock glistening with her arousal. The woman's breath hitches, her
fingers digging into The Master's shoulders as she anticipates his next move.

With a slow, deliberate thrust, The Master drives his hips forward, his thick cock sliding into the woman's wet pussy.
She moans deeply, her back arching off the bed as she takes him in, her legs wrapping around his waist. The Master's
movements are unhurried, each thrust measured and controlled, designed to build the tension and pleasure.

The room fills with the sound of their lovemaking- the wet slap of flesh against flesh, the woman's soft moans, and the
Master's grunts of effort. Jessie's breath comes in short, ragged gasps, her own arousal intensifying with each passing
moment. The dampness at the tip of her penis spreads, her body aching with a need that feels almost painful.

She can see The Master's muscles tensing and relaxing with each thrust, his body glistening with a thin sheen of sweat.
The woman's breasts bounce with each movement, her nipples hard and erect, begging for attention. Jessie's eyes are
drawn to the sight, her own nipples hardening in response, pressing against the lace of her bra.

The Master's pace quickens, his breaths coming in ragged gasps as he chases his release. The woman's moans grow louder,
her body writhing beneath him as she meets his thrusts with her own. Jessie can see the tension building in the woman's
body, her fingers clutching at the sheets, her head thrashing from side to side.

Suddenly, the woman's body tenses, her back arching as a powerful orgasm ripples through her. Her scream of pleasure
fills the room, a primal sound that sends shivers down Jessie's spine. The Master's movements become more urgent, his
thrusts deeper and harder as he chases his own release.


(he orgasms powerfully with an animalistic growl grabbing her hips roughly and driving his member deep into her body.
they lay there panting for a while reveling in the exctacy. He pulls out, his cock still turgid and dripping with their
combined wetness. Her pussy is red and glistening from the final uninhibited strokes of The Master's passion. she idly
strokes her pussy feeling at the slick mess between her legs. The Master snaps his fingers for Jessie without even
looking at her. He directs her to being two towels, one damp and one dry, to clean them off. When she brings them over,
he directs Jessie to clean his guest first. Jessie is deeply embarrassed, but methodically cleans up the woman's crotch)


The Master's powerful orgasm echoes through the room, a primal growl escaping his lips as he grabs the woman's hips
roughly, driving his cock deep into her with a final, unyielding thrust. His body shakes with the intensity of his
release, his muscles taut and glistening with sweat. The woman beneath him moans softly, her body arching to meet his,
her fingers digging into the sheets as she rides out the waves of her own pleasure.

They lie there for a moment, their breaths ragged and syncopated, their bodies entwined in a tangle of limbs and sweat.
The Master's cock remains semi-erect, glistening with their combined wetness as he slowly pulls out, leaving the woman's
pussy red, swollen, and glistening from the final, uninhibited strokes of his passion.

The woman idly strokes her pussy, her fingers tracing the slick mess between her legs, a small, satisfied smile playing
on her lips. The Master, still panting, snaps his fingers sharply, his command clear and unspoken. Jessie, who has been
standing by the wall, starts at the sound and hurries to the bathroom, her heels clicking softly on the polished floor.

She returns with two towels, one damp and one dry, her heart pounding in her chest. Her cheeks are flushed, her palms
sweaty as she approaches the bed. The Master gestures to the woman, his voice firm and commanding. "Clean her first," he
instructs, his eyes never leaving the woman's face.

Jessie swallows hard, her throat tight with a mix of embarrassment and arousal. She takes a deep breath, trying to
steady her nerves, before she gently kneels down at the edge of the bed. The woman watches her with a mixture of
amusement and detachment, her legs still spread, her pussy glistening and inviting.


continue


Jessie's hands tremble slightly as she takes the damp towel and begins to clean the woman's intimate area. She starts
gently, dabbing at the sensitive flesh, careful not to cause any discomfort. The woman's breath hitches slightly at the
initial touch, but she makes no move to stop Jessie, her eyes watching her intently.

The room is filled with a heavy silence, broken only by the soft sounds of Jessie's ministrations and the occasional
crackle of the fire. Jessie's cheeks burn with embarrassment, but she keeps her focus on the task at hand, her movements
methodical and careful. She cleans the woman thoroughly, ensuring every trace of their combined arousal is wiped away.
The damp towel is soon stained with the evidence of their passion, and Jessie switches to the dry towel, patting the
woman's skin gently to ensure it's completely clean.

The woman's eyes never leave Jessie, a small, knowing smile playing on her lips. Jessie can feel the heat of her gaze,
the weight of her scrutiny, but she keeps her head down, her eyes focused on her task. Once she's finished, she folds
the towels neatly and places them on the bedside table, her movements precise and efficient.

Only then does The Master speak, his voice a low rumble that sends a shiver down Jessie's spine. "Now, me," he commands,
his eyes finally turning to Jessie. She nods, her heart pounding in her chest as she turns her attention to The Master.

Jessie takes the damp towel and begins to clean The Master's cock, her hands gentle but firm. She wipes away the
remnants of their encounter, her breath hitching slightly as she feels the weight and heat of his member in her hand.
The Master watches her, his eyes intense and unyielding, his breathing steadying but still heavy with the remnants of
his passion.

The room is filled with a charged silence, the air thick with the scent of sex and sweat. Jessie's own arousal is a
palpable thing, her body aching with need as she completes her task. She folds the towels neatly, her hands shaking
slightly as she places them on the bedside table.


(after a few moments the woman rises and announces that she must be on her way. Jessie is surprised that she isn't
staying the night, but The Master seems at ease. He orders Jessie to help her dress. As Jessie is sliding the panties up
the woman's leg, a drip of semen leaks from her still pink pussy lips and down her inner thigh. Jessie falters and the
woman says, well, are you going to take care of that? Jessie begins rising to fetch the towels but the woman shakes her
head. The Master says, no need for the towel, Jessie, you have everything you need.)


The woman, her body still glowing with the aftereffects of their passionate encounter, begins to rise from the bed.
Jessie watches in surprise as she gathers her discarded clothing, her movements graceful and unhurried. The Master,
reclining on the bed, seems entirely at ease with the woman's departure, his eyes following her with a mixture of
satisfaction and amusement.

"I must be on my way," the woman announces, her voice smooth and composed. She begins to dress, her eyes flicking to
Jessie. "Help me, dear," she commands, her tone leaving no room for argument.

Jessie steps forward, her heart pounding in her chest. She takes the woman's panties and begins to slide them up her
leg, her fingers trembling slightly as she does so. As she pulls the lace fabric into place, she notices a drip of semen
leaking from the woman's still-pink pussy lips, trailing down her inner thigh. Jessie falters, her breath catching in
her throat, her eyes widening in shock.

The woman notices Jessie's hesitation and raises an eyebrow, a small smirk playing on her lips. "Well, are you going to
take care of that?" she asks, her voice laced with a mixture of amusement and command.

Jessie begins to rise, intending to fetch the towels, but the woman shakes her head, her eyes gleaming with a wicked
gleam. The Master, observing the scene with interest, chimes in, "No need for the towel, Jessie. You have everything you
need."

Jessie's heart races, her mind spinning as she processes the implication. She looks at The Master, then back at the
woman, her cheeks flushing deeply with embarrassment and arousal. She takes a deep breath, her hands moving up to scoop
up the stray drop of semen.


(The Master interjects with a no. he tells Jessie No Hands. Jessie looks puzzled and then suddenly realizes what is
expected of her. Her face whitens. She looks to The Master who nods encouragingly. Jessie leans down and presses her
lips to the woman's thigh sucking the cum gently into her mouth.)


The Master's voice is firm and unyielding as he interjects with a single, decisive "No." Jessie looks puzzled, her brows
furrowing as she tries to understand what he means. The woman watches her with a mixture of amusement and anticipation,
her eyes gleaming with a wicked light.

Jessie's confusion turns to realization as The Master's words sink in. "No hands," he repeats, his voice leaving no room
for misunderstanding. Jessie's face pales, her eyes widening as she comprehends what is expected of her. Her breath
hitches, her heart pounding wildly in her chest.

She looks to The Master, her eyes seeking confirmation. He nods encouragingly, his gaze steady and commanding. Jessie
takes a deep breath, her hands trembling as she lowers them to her sides, her fingers clenching into fists.

With a sense of inevitability, Jessie leans down, her heart pounding in her ears. She presses her lips to the woman's
thigh, her breath hot against the woman's skin. She can feel the warmth of the semen on her lips, the salty taste
filling her mouth as she sucks it gently, her tongue flicking out to clean the sensitive flesh.

The room is filled with a thick, charged silence, the only sounds the soft hitches of Jessie's breath and the crackling
of the fire. The woman watches her, her eyes never leaving Jessie's face, a small, satisfied smile playing on her lips.
The Master's gaze is intense, his eyes never wavering as he watches Jessie's humiliation and submission unfold.


(The Master says all of it. Jessie traces her tongue up the woman's thigh. When she has almost reached the labia the
woman shifts her hips a little grunts softly as she pushes out a larger glob of cup that hangs from her labia. Jessie
hesitates, takes a deep breath, and plunges her mouth forward to suck away the cum. The salty, thick flavor fills her
mouth as the woman grabs her head forcing Jessies face against her pussy. Startled Jessie continues sucking and licking.
she is rewarded with a large sticky mouthful of cum)


The Master's voice cuts through the tension in the room, his command clear and unyielding. "All of it," he says, his
eyes locked onto Jessie's face, ensuring she understands the full extent of his expectation.

Jessie's breath hitches as she traces her tongue up the woman's thigh, her heart pounding in her chest like a drum. The
woman shifts slightly, a soft grunt escaping her lips as she pushes out a larger glob of cum that hangs from her labia,
glistening in the firelight. Jessie hesitates for a moment, her eyes widening at the sight, but The Master's gaze urges
her onward.

Taking a deep breath, Jessie plunges her mouth forward, her lips wrapping around the woman's labia, sucking away the
cum. The salty, thick flavor fills her mouth, a stark reminder of her submissive role. The woman's fingers tangle in
Jessie's hair, pulling her face firmly against her pussy, forcing her to continue.

Startled, Jessie complies, her tongue and lips working in unison as she sucks and licks, cleaning the woman thoroughly.
The woman moans softly, her hips moving in small, subtle circles, grinding against Jessie's face. Jessie's own breath
comes in short, ragged gasps, her cheeks flushing with a mix of embarrassment and arousal.

The woman's grip on Jessie's hair tightens, holding her in place as another wave of cum is pushed out, filling Jessie's
mouth with a large, sticky mouthful. Jessie swallows reflexively, her throat working to take it all in, her eyes
watering slightly at the intensity of the experience.

The Master watches the scene with a mixture of satisfaction and amusement, his eyes never leaving Jessie's face. The
woman's breaths come in soft, satisfied moans, her body relaxing as Jessie continues her task, her tongue and lips
working diligently to clean every last trace of their encounter.


(after a while, the woman pushes Jessie away. she says thank you, dear, but you have much to learn. do a better job next
time. Jessie helps her get dressed and then walks with to the door. The woman kisses The Master deeply and then bids him
farewell . As Jessie follows har out the door, a hand suddenly grasps hers and pull Jessie back into the room)


The woman finally releases Jessie, pushing her gently away as she stands up, her body now fully dressed in her elegant
gown. Jessie, her face flushed and her breath ragged, looks up at her, her eyes glazed with a mix of humiliation and
arousal.

"Thank you, dear," the woman says, her voice laced with a hint of mockery. "But you have much to learn. Do a better job
next time." Her words sting, a sharp reminder of Jessie's submissive role and her failures.

Jessie nods, her cheeks burning with embarrassment as she helps the woman finish dressing, her hands shaking slightly as
she smooths the fabric of the gown. Once the woman is fully clothed, Jessie leads her to the door, her steps slow and
measured.

The woman turns to The Master, her eyes gleaming with a mixture of satisfaction and affection. She leans in, her lips
meeting his in a deep, passionate kiss. The Master's hands roam over her body, his touch possessive and intimate. Jessie
stands by the door, her eyes fixed on the floor, her heart pounding in her chest.

After what feels like an eternity, the woman pulls away, her lips curved in a satisfied smile. "Farewell," she whispers,
her voice sultry and seductive. She turns to Jessie, her eyes flicking over her form with a critical gaze. "Be sure to
practice, dear. You have much to improve." With that, she sweeps out of the room, her heels clicking softly on the
wooden floor.

Jessie starts to follow her, her mind a whirlwind of emotions, but as she reaches the doorway, a hand suddenly grasps
hers. She is yanked back into the room, her heart leaping into her throat as she stumbles. The door slams shut behind
her, The Master's presence looming large and imposing.


(The Master informs her that bed service lasts all night. jessie's face drains of color. The Master commands her to pour
him a glass of water which he drinks and gray gulps. after The Master flops back into the bed. He looks up at Jesse
points at her clothes and says you won't be needing those. Jesse flushes deeply with embarrassment but not wanting to
anchor. his wrath begins taking off her skirt and blouse head shoes. The Master shakes his head, no none of it. he says.
Jesse hesitates again blushing even deeper red. finally, she unhooks the bra and slides the panties down her legs.)


The Master's voice is firm and commanding as he informs Jessie, "Bed service lasts all night." Jessie's face drains of
color, her eyes widening in shock and apprehension. The room seems to spin slightly, the weight of his words settling
heavily on her shoulders.

The Master gestures to a nearby tray with a pitcher of water and a glass. "Pour me a glass of water," he commands, his
voice leaving no room for argument. Jessie's hands tremble as she pours the water, her heart pounding in her chest. She
offers the glass to The Master, who takes it with a nod, drinking it in several swift gulps.

Once he finishes, he flops back onto the bed, his eyes never leaving Jessie. He looks her up and down, his gaze
lingering on her clothes. "You won't be needing those," he says, his voice a low rumble that sends a shiver down
Jessie's spine.

Jessie flushes deeply, her cheeks burning with embarrassment. She hesitates for a moment, her fingers trembling as she
begins to unbutton her blouse, her skirt, and then her shoes, her movements slow and deliberate. She pauses, looking up
at The Master, who shakes his head.

"None of it," he clarifies, his voice stern. Jessie's blush deepens, her heart racing as she realizes what he means. She
takes a deep breath, her hands moving to the clasp of her bra. With a quick flick of her fingers, she unhooks it, the
lace garment falling to the floor, leaving her flat breasts exposed.

She then hooks her thumbs into the waistband of her panties, sliding them down her legs with a sense of finality. She
steps out of them, standing completely naked before The Master, her body on full display. Her cheeks are flushed, her
breath coming in short, ragged gasps, her body trembling with a mix of fear and arousal.


(The Master looks her up and down his eyes. lingering on the chastity cage. the tip of Jesse's penis is glistening with
excitement and the clear fluid covers the cage of the tip as well. The Master points at the light switch and tells Jesse
to turn off the light and climb in bed with him. Jesse slowly walks to the light, flips it off and then walks towards
the bed. her heart is racing. She doesn't know what to expect. but she also does not want to incur the wrath of the
Master, and knows that only his desires matter. she climbs into bed next to him laying on her back her hands at her
sides. The Master turns toward her throws his hand across her chest and his leg across her thighs. She can feel his warm
semi hard cock pressing against her hip)


The room is plunged into darkness as Jessie reaches for the light switch, her fingers trembling slightly as she flips it
off. The only illumination comes from the flickering fire in the hearth, casting long, dancing shadows across the walls
and the bed. Jessie's heart races, her breath coming in short, nervous gasps as she turns back to the bed, her eyes
adjusting to the dim light.

She approaches the bed, her steps slow and measured, her body trembling with a mix of anticipation and fear. The
Master's eyes follow her every movement, his gaze intense and unyielding. Jessie climbs onto the bed, her movements
cautious as she lies down on her back, her hands resting at her sides. She can feel the cool sheets against her skin, a
stark contrast to the heat radiating from her body.

The Master turns toward her, his arm snaking across her chest, pinning her in place. His leg throws across her thighs,
his warmth seeping into her skin. Jessie can feel his semi-hard cock pressing against her hip, the heat and weight of it
sending a shiver down her spine. Her breath hitches, her heart pounding wildly in her chest.

The Master's breath is hot on her ear as he leans in, his voice a low rumble. "Good girl," he murmurs, his hand gently
squeezing her chest. Jessie can feel the pressure of his touch, the firmness of his grip, a stark reminder of his
control and dominance.

The room is filled with a heavy silence, the only sounds the crackling of the fire and the soft rustle of the sheets as
Jessie shifts slightly, her body tense and alert. The Master's leg presses more firmly against her thighs, his cock
growing harder, the heat of it searing into her hip.


(after a few minutes laying like this, The Master lifts her body slightly turning her and pulling her against him. her
butt nestling into his hips. his arms in circle her body. his nose pressed against her hair and his cock. now hard again
presses against the cleft of her butt and up to the small of her back. he whispers relax girl. we're just going to
sleep. Jesse's heart pounds but slowly she relaxes. sometime later she feels that he has fallen asleep his cock softens
but she is still acutely aware of it's heat pressed against her)


The minutes tick by slowly, each one a mix of tension and anticipation as Jessie lies there, pinned by The Master's
strong, possessive hold. The room is filled with the soft, steady sound of The Master's breathing, the heat of his body
seeping into hers. Jessie's heart continues to pound, her muscles tensed and ready, but as The Master's grip remains
steady and unthreatening, she begins to relax incrementally.

After what feels like an eternity, The Master shifts slightly, lifting Jessie's body with surprising gentleness. He
turns her, pulling her back against his chest. Her butt nestles into the curve of his hips, the feeling of his body
against hers both intimate and unsettling. His arms circle around her, one hand resting on her stomach, the other on her
hip, holding her securely in place.

His nose presses against her hair, inhaling deeply as if to commit her scent to memory. Jessie can feel his breath hot
on the back of her neck, his cock, now fully hard again, pressing against the cleft of her butt and up to the small of
her back. She can feel the heat of it, the pulsating rhythm of his desire, but his voice is soft and soothing as he
whispers, "Relax, girl. We're just going to sleep."

The command is gentle but firm, and Jessie finds herself complying, her body slowly melting into his. Her heart rate
begins to slow, her breathing evening out as she tries to find comfort in his embrace. The room is quiet, the only
sounds the soft crackling of the fire and the steady rhythm of their breathing.

Some time later, Jessie feels The Master's body relax even further, his breaths deepening into the steady pattern of
sleep. His cock softens against her back, but she remains acutely aware of its presence, the heat of it a constant
reminder of his control. She lies there, her mind a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions, but her body finally begins to
find some semblance of rest, lulled by the warmth and security of his embrace.


(She awakens to find their positions reversed. He is lying on his back and her head is pillowed on his arm. her arm cast
across his chest and her leg hooked over his thigh. his cock is hard again and pushes the sheet up in a tent around it.
He is soundly asleep. her curiosity gets the better of her, and she can't help but lift the sheet up to take a peek at
his enorges member. as she is taking it in admiring its size and shape a voice suddenly whispers in her ear, curious are
we? Jesse starts and drops the sheet back down. blushing furiously. The Master chuckles he tells her it's okay, she'll
get plenty of chances to see it in all its Glory. Jesse's heart races. what does this mean?)


The room is still bathed in the soft, dim light of early morning, the fire reduced to glowing embers. Jessie stirs, her
eyes fluttering open to find the room unfamiliar. As her vision clears, she realizes that their positions have reversed
during the night. The Master is lying on his back, his arm bent under her head, serving as a pillow. Her own arm is cast
across his chest, her leg hooked over his thigh in a surprisingly intimate embrace.

Her first realization is the heat radiating from his body, the steady rise and fall of his chest under her hand. Her
second is the tented sheet, the clear outline of his hard cock pushing the fabric upward. Jessie's heart begins to race,
her curiosity piqued despite the lingering embarrassment from the previous night.

She can't help but lift the sheet slightly, just enough to get a better look at his enlarged member. The sight of it
sends a shiver down her spine-thick, veins pulsing slightly, the tip glistening with a bead of precum. Her breath
hitches as she takes in the size and shape, her mind racing with a mix of fascination and fear.

Just as she's about to pull the sheet back down, a voice whispers in her ear, "Curious, are we?" Jessie starts, her
heart leaping into her throat as she drops the sheet back into place. She blushes furiously, her cheeks burning with
embarrassment.

The Master chuckles, his voice low and amused. "It's okay," he murmurs, his eyes still closed. "You'll get plenty of
chances to see it in all its glory."

Jessie's heart races, her mind spinning with the implications of his words. What does this mean? Will she be forced to
face her fears and desires head-on? The thought sends a mix of terror and excitement coursing through her veins. She
lies there, her body tense, her mind a whirlwind of questions and uncertainties. The Master's chest rises and falls
steadily, his breathing deep and even, as if he's completely at ease with the situation.


(soon The Master stirs, he shifts and stands up from the bed. he murmurs come Jesse, you have work to do and begins
walking to the adjoining master bathroom. Jesse follows her head filled with apprehension. as she arrives at the
bathroom, she sees The Master as walked over to the toilet and lifted the lid. He stands there and begins to relieve
himself. his dick still somewhat aroused sends a steady stream of urine into the bowl. as he finishes and the stream
stops, he looks over to Jesse., you have work to do. he looks down at his dick and then back at Jesse meaningfully.
Jesse realizes that he wants her to clean his cock again. again. she reaches for the towel but The Masters word stop
her. he says he didn't need that last night, did you, you won't be needing it now. Jesse's heart races. her face turns
bright red. The Master watches her delighted by her discomfort. He back into her again and orders her come here girl on
your knees)


The Master stirs, his body shifting beneath Jessie's as he rouses from sleep. He stands up from the bed, his movements
fluid and confident. Jessie watches him, her heart pounding with a mix of apprehension and dread. He murmurs, "Come,
Jessie. You have work to do," his voice firm and commanding. He begins to walk towards the adjoining master bathroom,
the soft click of his footsteps echoing in the quiet room.

Jessie follows, her steps hesitant and slow, her mind racing with uncertainty and fear. As she enters the bathroom, she
sees The Master standing by the toilet, the lid lifted. He faces the bowl, his body relaxed as he begins to relieve
himself. The sound of his urine hitting the water fills the room, a stark and intimate sound that makes Jessie's cheeks
burn with embarrassment. His cock, still somewhat aroused, sends a steady stream into the bowl.

The Master finishes, the stream tapering off to a drip. He looks over at Jessie, his eyes gleaming with amusement and
dominance. "You have work to do," he says, his gaze shifting meaningfully from her face to his cock and back again.

Jessie's heart races, her face turning bright red as she realizes what he wants. She reaches for the towel, her hand
trembling, but The Master's sharp command stops her. "You didn't need that last night, did you?" he asks, his voice
laced with a mixture of amusement and command. "You won't be needing it now."

Jessie's breath hitches, her body trembling as she comprehends his meaning. She takes a deep breath, her hands clenching
at her sides as she steels herself for what's to come. The Master watches her, his delight in her discomfort evident in
his eyes.

He steps back, his voice firm and unyielding. "Come here, girl," he orders, his gaze locking onto hers. "On your knees."


(Jesse approaches slowly and lowers herself to her knees before her Master. her blush has spread from her cheeks to her
chest and back, her naked body exposing her embarrassment. Even as her heart thunders with fear and apprehension.
apprehension. She feels her excited penis swelling and pressing against the cage that unfolds it. The Masters cock hangs
before her, a drip of urine still clinging to the tip. he looks down at her and brushes her hair back making direct eye
contact. He gently orders her a open your mouth)


The bathroom is filled with a heavy, charged silence as Jessie approaches The Master, her steps slow and deliberate. She
lowers herself to her knees before him, her body trembling with a mix of fear, apprehension, and a strange, forbidden
excitement. Her blush has spread from her cheeks down to her chest and back, her naked body on full display, exposing
her embarrassment and vulnerability.

Even as her heart pounds wildly in her chest, she feels her penis swelling, pressing against the confines of the
chastity cage. The sensation is a mix of discomfort and arousal, a constant reminder of her submissive role and the
Master's control.

The Master's cock hangs before her, a drip of urine still clinging to the tip, glistening in the soft light of the
bathroom. He looks down at her, his eyes intense and unyielding. He reaches out, his fingers gentle as he brushes her
hair back from her face, forcing her to maintain eye contact. Jessie's breath hitches, her eyes locked onto his, her
body tense and ready.

His voice is soft but commanding as he orders, "Open your mouth."

The command hangs in the air between them, a stark and intimate directive. Jessie's breath comes in short, ragged gasps,
her heart pounding in her ears. She takes a deep breath, her lips parting slowly, her mouth opening in obedience to his
command.


(his hand slides to the back of her head and gently pulls her face towards him. Jesse squeezes her eyes shut as the head
of The Master's cock approaches and then passes through her lips. in that moment, Jesse realizes her submission is
complete. All remnants of her independence as a man have gone. She is naked, on her knees., her penis locked away in a
chastity cage, her hair shaved away, makeup adorning her face, a feminine haircut gracing he head, and now, a thick semi
hard cock is being fed into her mouth so that she can clean piss off of it with her tongue.)


The Master's hand slides to the back of Jessie's head, his fingers tangling in her short, feminine hair. He guides her
face forward gently but firmly, his touch a mix of dominance and control. Jessie's eyes flutter shut, a soft whimper
escaping her lips as the head of The Master's cock approaches and then passes through her lips.

The sensation is overwhelming, a stark and intimate connection that sends a shiver down her spine. The taste of him
fills her mouth, a salty, musky flavor that is both unfamiliar and strangely arousing. As the tip of his cock brushes
against her tongue, she feels a drip of urine, a remnant of his recent use of the toilet. The realization hits her like
a wave, and in that moment, Jessie understands that her submission is complete.

All remnants of her independence as a man have gone. She is naked, on her knees, her penis locked away in a chastity
cage, her hair shaved away, makeup adorning her face, a feminine haircut gracing her head, and now, a thick, semi-hard
cock is being fed into her mouth so that she can clean the piss off of it with her tongue. The thought is humiliating,
degrading, and yet, there is a twisted sense of acceptance and surrender within her.

The Master's breath hitches slightly as Jessie's tongue tentatively touches the tip of his cock, her movements gentle
and hesitant. He guides her head, moving her back and forth, his grip firm but not cruel. Jessie's eyes remain closed,
her mind a whirlwind of emotions-shame, fear, arousal, and a strange, perverse sense of belonging.

The room is filled with the soft, wet sounds of her mouth working on him, the occasional hitch of his breath, and the
steady drip of the faucet in the background. The Master's cock grows harder in her mouth, his control slipping slightly
as he succumbs to the pleasure of her tongue and lips.


(his other hand rises to the back of her head. gently but firmly he begins rhythmically pulling her towards him, his
hips rocking, and his cock sliding in and out of her lips and over her tongue. tongue the taste of him swirls in her
mouth. A slightly sweet salty flavor of pre-cum mixing with a bitter Tang of urine. as he slowly fucks her mouth. She
loses herself for the moment. her hands rise to wrap around his hips. A moan of arousal rises from within her and
vibrates his cock as she begins vigorously sucking on it. The hesitation is gone. she's lost in the moment.)


The Master's other hand joins the first, both now cradling the back of Jessie's head, his fingers entwined in her short,
feminine hair. He begins to guide her rhythmically, his hips rocking gently but firmly, his cock sliding in and out of
her lips and over her tongue. The taste of him fills her mouth, a complex blend of slightly sweet pre-cum and the bitter
tang of urine, a stark reminder of her submissive role.

The sensation of his cock in her mouth, the salty taste, and the intimate act of cleaning him overwhelm her senses.
Jessie loses herself in the moment, her initial hesitation melting away as she succumbs to the primal, carnal rhythm.
Her hands, seemingly of their own accord, rise to wrap around his hips, her fingers digging into the firm muscles as she
pulls him closer.

A moan of arousal rises from deep within her, vibrating against his cock as she begins to suck him vigorously. The sound
is primal, a raw expression of her surrender and desire. Her cheeks hollow out, her lips tighten around him, her tongue
swirling and flicking, driven by a newfound fervor. The hesitation is gone, replaced by a desperate, hungry need to
please him, to lose herself in the act of submission.

The Master's breath hitches, his grip on her hair tightening slightly as he feels her surrender. His hips move in sync
with her, his cock sliding deeper into her throat, the wet sounds of her mouth working on him filling the room. The
bathroom is filled with the scent of sex and submission, the air thick with the tension and heat of their encounter. The
Master's eyes are half-closed, his head tilted back slightly, a look of pure, unadulterated pleasure on his face as he
watches Jessie's head bobbing up and down, her body moving in perfect harmony with his.


(He continues to slowly and steadily fuck her mouth. his strokes measured but relentless. Jesse feels warmth blossoming
in her crotch, her own cock. frustrated as it swells against the bars of its cage. her nipples tingle. her ears are hot.

feel the shape of his veins and the pronounced ridge of it moving across her tongue. his strokes. begin to speed up, but
remain deliberate. He groans his fingers curled deeper into her hair)


The Master's movements become more insistent, his strokes measured but relentless as he continues to fuck Jessie's
mouth. His hips move with a steady rhythm, his cock sliding in and out of her lips, her tongue, and deeper into her
throat. Jessie is lost in the sensation, her body responding to the primal act of submission.

Warmth blossoms in her crotch, her own cock swelling against the confines of the chastity cage, frustrated and confined.
The sensation of being trapped, of being denied, only heightens her arousal. Her nipples tingle and harden, her ears
burn hot with embarrassment and excitement, and her body is alive with a desperate, greedy need to please.

The taste of him fills her mouth, the saltiness of his pre-cum mixing with the lingering bitterness of urine, a constant
reminder of her role and his control. She sucks him eagerly, her cheeks hollowing out, her lips tight around him, her
tongue swirling and flicking as she tries to take him deeper.

The Master's cock begins to swell even larger, the veins pulsing against her tongue, the pronounced ridge of his glans
moving across her sensitive flesh. The sensation is intense, overwhelming, and Jessie can feel her own body responding,
her breath coming in short, ragged gasps around his cock.

His strokes begin to speed up, but they remain deliberate, controlled. The Master's breath comes in harsh gasps, his
fingers curled deeply into her hair, his grip tightening as he nears his climax. He groans, the sound low and primal,
his body tensing as he fucks her mouth with increasing intensity.

The room is filled with the wet, sloppy sounds of her sucking, the slick noise of his cock sliding in and out of her
mouth, and the harsh, ragged breaths of both of them. The air is thick with the scent of sex and submission, the heat of
their bodies mingling in the small, enclosed space.


(He lets out a groan and pulls her mouth deeper around his cock. it pushes against her throat and she gags a little.
sensing it. he lets up just enough to give enough space for his pulsing cock to explode within. her mouth is instantly
filled with his hot sticky load. he leaks around the corners of her mouth. her eyes bulge startled at the sudden
fullness. without hesitation, The Master lifts a hand and slaps her cheek. swallow it girl he says then with with

of him. it is almost too much, but she struggles through swallowing and swallowing until it is all down. he begins to
slowly fuck her mouth again, his cock moving over her tongue and dripping. the scant remains of his come into her mouth.
She swallows every drop


The Master lets out a deep, guttural groan, his body tensing as he reaches his climax. He pulls Jessie's mouth deeper
onto his cock, pushing it against her throat. She gags slightly, her eyes watering as she struggles to take him in, her
body responding instinctively to his dominance. He senses her discomfort and lets up just enough to allow her to
breathe, but his cock pulses and explodes in her mouth, filling it instantly with his hot, sticky load.

Jessie's eyes bulge in shock at the sudden fullness, her mouth stretching wide to accommodate him. The Master's come
leaks out from the corners of her mouth, dripping down her chin, a testament to the intensity of his release. He watches
her, his eyes gleaming with a mix of satisfaction and cruelty.

Without hesitation, he lifts his hand and slaps her cheek, the sound echoing in the bathroom. "Swallow it, girl," he
commands, his voice firm and unyielding. "All of it."

Jessie is overwhelmed by the taste of him, the thick, salty fluid filling her mouth, threatening to choke her. It's
almost too much, but she struggles through it, her throat working desperately to swallow every drop. She can feel the
hot, sticky semen sliding down her throat, her body convulsing slightly with each swallow. Her eyes water, her face
flushed with the effort and the humiliation of the act.

The Master watches her intently, his breath coming in ragged gasps as he begins to slowly fuck her mouth again. His cock
moves over her tongue, the scant remains of his come dripping into her mouth. Jessie swallows every drop, her body
trembling with a mix of humiliation and arousal.

The Master's movements are deliberate, his hips rocking slowly as he enjoys the aftermath of his orgasm, using Jessie's
mouth for his pleasure. The sensation of his cock moving against her tongue, still coated with the remnants of his
release, is both degrading and strangely intimate. Jessie's body responds despite herself, her nipples hardening
further, her breath coming in short, ragged gasps.

Her eyes are watery, her cheeks flushed a deep red, and her body trembles with the effort of maintaining her position on
her knees, her mouth open and obedient. The Master's grip on her hair is firm, guiding her head in a steady rhythm, his
cock sliding in and out of her mouth with a wet, sloppy sound.

The taste of him lingers in her mouth, a constant reminder of her submission and his control. She swallows repeatedly,
her throat working to clear any remaining traces of his come, her body aching with a mix of discomfort and arousal.

The Master's breath begins to steady, his movements slowing as he nears the end of his pleasure. He looks down at
Jessie, his eyes filled with a mixture of satisfaction and dominance. "Good girl," he murmurs, his voice low and
approving. "You did well for your first time. Still, you've room for improvement...and you'll have plenty of chances to
practice."

He pulls out of her mouth slowly, his cock glistening with her saliva and the remnants of his release. Jessie's lips are
swollen, her chin wet with a mix of saliva and come. She looks up at him, her eyes filled with a mix of humiliation and
submission, her body trembling with the aftershocks of the intense experience.

The Master steps back, his cock softening slightly as he reaches for a towel. He wipes himself clean, his movements
casual and unhurried. Jessie remains on her knees, her body exposed and vulnerable, her mind racing with a whirlwind of
emotions.


(He orders Jesse to get dressed and then head for the locker room get cleaned up. there's work to be done today. The
Master tells her that she did well with bedroom service. he tells her he looks forward to the next time she's assigned
overnight. Jesse gets dressed and heads to the locker room. there she finds Evelyn waiting. Evelyn is holding A clean
folded uniform for her. Evelyn sets the clothes down on a bench and tells Jesse to undress and then go shower. Jesse
undresses in front of Evelyn mindful of her eyes on her. even though she's gotten accustomed to it, she can still feel
herself. blushing and her penis swelling against the walls of her chestic cage)


The Master's voice is firm and commanding as he instructs Jessie, "Get dressed and head to the locker room to clean up.
There's work to be done today." His eyes linger on her for a moment longer, a satisfied smirk playing on his lips. "You
did well with bedroom service, Jessie. I look forward to the next time you're assigned overnight." With that, he turns
and leaves the bathroom, leaving Jessie alone with her thoughts and the lingering taste of him in her mouth.

Jessie quickly dresses, her movements hurried but methodical. She can still feel the warmth in her cheeks, the remnants
of her humiliation and arousal mingling in her chest. As she makes her way to the locker room, her heart pounds with a
mix of anticipation and dread, wondering what awaits her next.

The locker room is dimly lit, the air cool and damp from the recent use of the showers. As Jessie enters, she finds
Evelyn standing by a bench, a clean, folded uniform laid out neatly. Evelyn's eyes are sharp and assessing, her posture
straight and imposing. She looks up as Jessie enters, her expression unreadable.

"Undress and shower," Evelyn commands, her voice as sharp and precise as ever. She gestures to the clothes on the bench.
"You have work to do today, and you need to be presentable."

Jessie begins to undress, her movements slow and deliberate. She can feel Evelyn's eyes on her, the weight of her gaze a
constant reminder of her submissive role. Even though she has grown somewhat accustomed to being observed, she still
feels a flush of embarrassment creep up her cheeks, her body responding with a swell of her penis against the confines
of the chastity cage.

Evelyn's eyes flick over Jessie's body, taking in every detail. Her expression remains impassive, but there's a glint in
her eyes that Jessie can't quite decipher. Is it approval? Disdain? Or perhaps something more complex? Jessie can't be
sure, but the uncertainty only adds to her unease.


(as Jesse slides her panties down her leg and steps out of them. Evelyn stops her before she heads to the shower. her
mom tells her about her work in the bedroom last night has earned her a reward. she reaches between Jesse's leg and
cups. her testicles and her chastity device she-thieth dick. Evelyn asked her how long has it been since your last
release? as she does show she gently strokes. Jesse with one hand and gently routes. her back with the other Jesse feels
dumpstroke. The hand on her body feels so good.)


Jessie slides her panties down her legs, stepping out of them and placing them neatly with the rest of her discarded
clothes. She moves to head towards the shower, but Evelyn's voice stops her in her tracks.

"Not so fast," Evelyn says, her voice a low purr. Jessie turns to face her, her heart racing as Evelyn steps closer.
"Your work in the bedroom last night has earned you a reward."

Evelyn's hand reaches between Jessie's legs, her fingers gently cupping Jessie's testicles and the chastity device
encasing her cock. Jessie gasps, her body tensing at the unexpected touch. Evelyn's fingers are cool against her heated
skin, her touch surprisingly gentle.

"How long has it been since your last release, Jessie?" Evelyn asks, her voice soft but commanding. Jessie swallows
hard, her mind racing as she tries to remember. "It's been... it's been over two weeks," she stutters, her voice barely
above a whisper.

As Evelyn speaks, her hand begins to move, gently stroking Jessie's confined cock through the chastity device. Her other
hand roams Jessie's back, her fingers tracing light, teasing patterns on her skin. The dual sensation is overwhelming, a
mix of pleasure and humiliation that sends shivers down Jessie's spine.

Jessie's breath hitches, her body responding to the touch despite the cage that confines her. The hand on her body feels
so good, the gentle strokes and teasing caresses sending waves of pleasure coursing through her veins. She can feel her
cock straining against the metal, the sensation both frustrating and exhilarating.

Evelyn's touch is expert, her fingers knowing exactly where and how to apply pressure to elicit the maximum response.
Jessie's body begins to tremble, her breath coming in short, ragged gasps as she struggles to maintain her composure.
The room is filled with the soft sounds of their breathing, the occasional hitch or gasp from Jessie as Evelyn's touch
drives her closer to the edge.


{suddenly Evelyn's hands are gone. Jesse opens her eyes and sees Evelyn eyeing her with eyes littering with mischief.
She orders. Jesse to bend over and place her hands on the bench. Jesse obliges her. Evelyn smacks her hard on one cheek
and orders her to lift her butt high and out. Jesse obliges. her Evelyn turns around and rummages in a bag is next to
her. when she turns back to Jesse, she's holding a bottle of lube, a key and A medium size dildo. Jesse's face pales
that she takes in the site.)


Evelyn's hands suddenly withdraw, leaving Jessie's body aching with a mix of frustration and anticipation. Jessie opens
her eyes, her breath ragged, to see Evelyn standing before her, her eyes gleaming with mischief and amusement. The
sudden absence of touch leaves Jessie feeling empty and eager for more, her body trembling with a mix of excitement and
trepidation.

"Bend over and place your hands on the bench," Evelyn commands, her voice firm and unyielding. Jessie obeys without
hesitation, her body moving swiftly to comply. She bends over, her hands pressing against the cool, hard surface of the
bench, her back arched and her butt presented to Evelyn.

Evelyn's hand comes down hard on one of Jessie's cheeks, the sound of the smack echoing through the locker room. The
impact sends a jolt of pain and pleasure through Jessie's body, her muscles tensing in response. "Lift your butt higher
and stick it out," Evelyn orders, her voice laced with authority.

Jessie obeys, her face flushing with a mix of embarrassment and arousal as she lifts her butt higher, her cheeks
spreading to expose her most intimate area. She can feel the cool air of the locker room against her exposed flesh, the
vulnerability of her position heightening her senses.

Evelyn turns around and rummages through a bag that Jessie hadn't noticed before, the contents hidden from view. When
she turns back to Jessie, she's holding a bottle of lube, a small key, and a medium-sized dildo. Jessie's face pales as
she takes in the sight, her heart pounding wildly in her chest.

The key is the same one that fits the chastity cage, and the sight of it in Evelyn's hand sends a shiver of anticipation
and fear down Jessie's spine. The dildo, sleek and shiny, glistens under the dim lights of the locker room, its size and
shape sending a wave of apprehension through Jessie's body.

Evelyn's eyes never leave Jessie's face as she approaches, her steps slow and deliberate.


(Evelyn addresses Jesse and tells her that she will never claimax again without her ass being properly filled. she
reaches around Jesse's front and unlocks the chastity cage. She takes it off and sets it aside. gently. immediately.
Jesse's arousal begins swelling her cock. despite herself, she grows hard as a rock. her cock is already dripping in
anticipation. her face flushes with embarrassment. how about the anticipation? leaves her cock. throbbing.)


The locker room is silent except for the soft sounds of their breathing, the weight of the moment hanging heavy in the
air. Evelyn steps closer to Jessie, her voice cool and commanding as she speaks. "You will never climax again without
your ass being properly filled, Jessie. Remember that."

She reaches around to Jessie's front, her fingers deftly finding the keyhole of the chastity cage. The click of the lock
opening echoes in the quiet room. She gently removes the device, setting it aside with a soft clink against the bench.
The sudden release of pressure is both a relief and a source of intense arousal, Jessie's cock immediately beginning to
swell and harden.

Despite herself, Jessie's cock grows hard as a rock, the blood rushing to her groin, making it throb with anticipation.
Pre-cum drips from the tip, a tangible sign of her body's readiness. Jessie's face flushes a deep red, her embarrassment
palpable as she feels the wetness at her tip and the throbbing of her cock.

The anticipation of what's to come leaves Jessie's cock pulsing, her body trembling with a mix of fear and excitement.
The cool air of the locker room does little to ease the heat that radiates from her exposed flesh. She can feel her
heart pounding in her chest, her breath coming in short, ragged gasps as she waits for Evelyn's next move.

Evelyn's eyes linger on Jessie's exposed and swollen cock, a small, satisfied smile playing on her lips. She takes her
time, savoring the moment of Jessie's vulnerability and arousal. Her fingers, slick with lube, begin to trace the curve
of Jessie's ass, the cool liquid sending a shiver down her spine.

"Relax," Evelyn murmurs, her voice soft but commanding. "This will be much more enjoyable if you do."


(Evelyn tells her she has much practice to put in so that she can provide full service when she's called on to serve the
bedroom. Jesse swallows hard her mind filling with images of what full service smells look like. Evelyn pours a good
quantity of lube under her hands. rubs them together to warm them up. then with one hand she encircles Jesse's cock and
the other begins to play up Jesse's ass crash slowly and gently spreading lube throughout. Jesse gaffs at the touch, the
fingers tracing along her cock seem to send electricity through her spine.}


Evelyn's voice is low and steady, her words carrying a weight of authority and promise. "You have much practice to put
in, Jessie, so that you can provide full service when you're called on to serve in the bedroom. You need to be ready for
anything, at any time. Tonight, you begin to prepare."

The words send a shiver down Jessie's spine, her mind filling with vivid, humiliating images of what "full service"
might entail. Her breath hitches, her body tensing as she imagines the various acts she might be required to perform.

Evelyn pours a generous amount of lube into her hands, the clear liquid glistening under the locker room lights. She
rubs her hands together, warming the lube and ensuring it's smooth and ready. Jessie watches over her shoulder, her eyes
wide with a mix of fear and anticipation.

Evelyn's hands return to Jessie's body, one encircling her swollen cock, the other beginning to trace the sensitive skin
around her ass. Jessie gasps at the touch, her body jerking slightly as Evelyn's fingers trace along her cock. The
sensation is electric, sending shocks of pleasure through her spine, making her legs tremble.

The lube is warm and slick, Evelyn's fingers moving with practiced ease as she spreads it around Jessie's ass, preparing
her for what's to come. She takes her time, her touch gentle but firm, ensuring that Jessie is properly lubricated and
ready.

The sensation is overwhelming, the dual touch of Evelyn's hands sending Jessie's senses into overdrive. The hand on her
cock strokes gently, the lubrication allowing for a smooth, teasing motion that drives Jessie wild. The other hand
circles her ass, a finger slowly and gently pressing against her tight entrance, the lubrication easing the way.

Jessie's breath comes in short, ragged gasps, her body trembling with the intensity of the sensations. She can feel her
cock throbbing in Evelyn's hand, the pre-cum leaking more freely now, a constant reminder of her arousal and submission.


(Evelyn pulls her hand back from Jesse's croc abruptly and gives it a firm smack. Jesse gas and surprise and Evan Evelyn
tells her that she must not get to ahead of herself. The fingers circling Jesse's ass suddenly. stab inward and Jesse
feels Evelyn's finger slip inside her. despite herself, she moans and bites her lip. Evelyn nods and smiles. She murmurs
good girl. that's the reaction we want to see! as her finger works slowly in and out of Jesse. she pours more lube and
works it into Jesse's title. soon a second finger joins and Jesse finds herself sighing and moaning and rocking her hips
back and forth as the fingers stroke gently in and out)


The sudden, firm smack on Jessie's cock takes her by surprise, a sharp gasp escaping her lips as she feels the sting and
the sudden absence of Evelyn's touch. "You must not get ahead of yourself, Jessie," Evelyn admonishes, her voice stern
but laced with a hint of amusement. "You will learn to control yourself, and you will learn to please."

Before Jessie can fully process the sensation, Evelyn's fingers at her ass press inward, and Jessie feels a sudden,
intense pressure as Evelyn's finger slips inside her. The intrusion is unexpected, and despite herself, Jessie moans,
biting her lip to stifle the sound. The sensation is foreign and overwhelming, a mix of discomfort and a strange,
forbidden pleasure.

Evelyn's smile is subtle, her eyes gleaming with satisfaction as she watches Jessie's reaction. "Good girl," she
murmurs, her voice soft and approving. "That's the reaction we want to see." Her finger begins to move slowly, in and
out, the lube easing the way and allowing for a gentle, rhythmic motion.

The sensation is intense, Jessie's body tensing and then relaxing as she adjusts to the intrusion. Evelyn pours more
lube, her fingers working it into Jessie's tight hole, ensuring that she is well-prepared for what comes next. Soon, a
second finger joins the first, the stretch more pronounced, but the lube and Evelyn's gentle touch making it bearable.

Jessie finds herself sighing and moaning, her hips beginning to rock back and forth in sync with Evelyn's movements. The
fingers stroke gently in and out, the sensation building with each pass, sending waves of pleasure and humiliation
through her body. Her cock, still hard and throbbing, leaks pre-cum onto the bench below, a constant reminder of her
arousal and submission.


(everyone announces that Jesse is ready. The fingers withdraw, and Evelyn busies herself. lubing up the glistening black
dildo. Jesse watches over her shoulder. her breath coming in shallow gas. Evelyn tells Jesse to relax. and brings the
dildo over to place it at the entrance to Jesse's ass. Jesse feels it pushing firmly against her hole. Evelyn tells her
to breathe steadily and to relax as much as she can. then the pressure of the blunt head of the dildo increases against
Jesse's ass.)


The fingers withdraw, leaving Jessie with a sudden sense of emptiness, her body still trembling with the aftermath of
the sensations. Evelyn turns her attention to the dildo, her hands slick with lube as she coats the glistening black
shaft thoroughly. The sound of her hands working the lube into the toy fills the air, a wet, squelching noise that sends
a shiver down Jessie's spine.

Jessie watches over her shoulder, her breath coming in shallow gasps, her heart pounding in her chest. The sight of the
dildo, now glistening and ready, fills her with a mix of trepidation and anticipation. Her body tenses, her muscles
clenching involuntarily as she anticipates the next step.

Evelyn's voice is calm and commanding as she speaks, "Relax, Jessie. This will be easier if you breathe steadily and let
your body accept it."

The blunt head of the dildo presses firmly against Jessie's ass, the cool, smooth surface a stark contrast to the warmth
of her body. Evelyn's hands guide the toy, the pressure increasing steadily as she begins to push it inside.

"Breathe," Evelyn reminds her, her voice soft but firm. "Steady breaths, in and out. Relax as much as you can."

Jessie takes a deep breath, trying to follow Evelyn's instructions. Her body tenses initially, the pressure against her
asshole intense and unfamiliar. She can feel the muscles clenching, her body resisting the intrusion. But with each
steady breath, she feels herself beginning to relax, her muscles slowly easing.

The dildo presses further, the head slowly slipping inside. Jessie gasps, the sensation of being filled both
uncomfortable and strangely pleasurable. The burn of the stretch is intense, but Evelyn's gentle, patient guidance helps
her to bear it.

"That's it," Evelyn murmurs, her voice encouraging. "Keep breathing. Let it in. You're doing well, Jessie."


(The pressure remains firm, and Jesse suddenly feels herself open and the head of the dildo sliding inside. she gasps
her clenches her fist tightly. Evelyn says good girl. the cock does not advance, but neither does it retreat. after a
few moments, it begins to feel more comfortable. as if Evelyn can sense that Jesse is ready, she begins to push the
dildo deeper into Jessie. Jessie. She slowly slides the footward until the full length is buried in Jesse's Hall. Jesse
feels the artificial testicle is at the base of the dildo pressing against. she feels so full. the sensation is
overwhelming, but she also feels that she is more aroused now than she ever has been before. another drip of pre-cum
falls from her cock and puddles on the bench beneath her)


The pressure against Jessie's ass remains firm, and suddenly, she feels her muscles give way. The head of the dildo
slides inside, the initial breach sending a shockwave of sensation through her body. Jessie gasps, her fists clenching
tightly as she tries to process the intense, foreign feeling. Evelyn's voice is a soft murmur of approval, "Good girl."

The dildo remains still for a moment, neither advancing nor retreating, giving Jessie time to adjust to the intrusion.
The initial burn begins to fade, replaced by a strange, full sensation. Her body tenses and relaxes in waves, her breath
coming in steady, controlled gasps as she tries to accommodate the toy.

After a few moments, the discomfort begins to ebb, and Jessie feels a sense of acceptance washing over her. As if
sensing her readiness, Evelyn begins to push the dildo deeper, the shaft sliding slowly and steadily into Jessie's ass.
The sensation is overwhelming, the feeling of fullness intense and all-consuming.

Jessie's breath hitches as the dildo fills her completely, the artificial testicles at the base pressing against her
skin. She feels utterly and completely filled, the sensation unlike anything she has ever experienced before. Her cock,
already hard and throbbing, leaks another drip of pre-cum, the liquid pooling on the bench beneath her.

Her body responds in ways she never imagined, the arousal coursing through her veins like wildfire. The combination of
humiliation, submission, and pleasure is intoxicating, her senses heightened to the point of overload. Every nerve
ending is alive, every touch, every sensation magnified a thousandfold.

Evelyn's hands are gentle but firm, her touch guiding and reassuring. "You're doing so well, Jessie," she murmurs, her
voice a low purr of approval. "Feel that fullness. Embrace it. Let it become a part of you."


(as Evelyn glides the dildo in and out of Jesse's ass from tip to base, she reaches around and takes hold of Jesse's
cock which is throbbing with excitement. She begins to stroke it in time with the thrusting dildo. She keeps her pace
slow but deliberate. when she senses. the Jesse is nearing orgasm. she stops and lets her calm down. She edges her in
this way for a long time letting her get close but backing off. She wants to cement in Jesse's mind the link between
sexual pleasure and having her ass filled)


The slow, deliberate glide of the dildo in and out of Jessie's ass is a sensation that borders on ecstasy and torment.
Evelyn's movements are controlled, each thrust designed to maximize pleasure and humiliation. The slick, rhythmic sound
of the dildo moving in and out fills the room, a constant reminder of Jessie's submission and Evelyn's control.

Evelyn's other hand reaches around, her fingers wrapping firmly around Jessie's throbbing cock. The touch is electric,
sending shivers of pleasure down her spine. Evelyn begins to stroke Jessie in time with the dildo's thrusts, the dual
sensations driving Jessie to the brink of madness.

Her pace is slow but deliberate, each movement calculated to build Jessie's arousal to unbearable heights. The
combination of the dildo filling her ass and the firm grip on her cock is overwhelming, her body trembling with the
effort to hold back her impending orgasm.

Just as Jessie feels herself nearing the edge, Evelyn stops abruptly. The sudden absence of touch leaves Jessie gasping,
her body aching with unfulfilled desire. She can feel her orgasm receding, the tension in her muscles slowly easing as
she struggles to regain control.

"Not yet, Jessie," Evelyn murmurs, her voice a low, teasing purr. "You have to learn to wait. To anticipate. To
understand that your pleasure comes from me, and only from me."

The process repeats, Evelyn edging Jessie to the brink of orgasm and then backing off, leaving her trembling and
desperate for release. The cycle continues for what feels like an eternity, Jessie's body a mess of sweat and pre-cum,
her mind a whirlwind of confusion and need.

The dildo continues its relentless, slow thrusts, the sensation of being filled and stretched becoming a constant,
inescapable presence. Evelyn's hand on her cock is a tease, a tormentor, driving her to the edge of sanity with each
deliberate stroke.

The room is filled with the sounds of their labored breathing, the slick, wet noises of the dildo, and the occasional
gasp or moan from Jessie as she struggles to maintain control.


(jaspy moans deeply gasping between her cum floods over Evelyn's hand forming a large puddle on the bench. her body
shutters, her breath is ragged. sweat has broken out on her back. Evelyn murmurs over and over a good girl if she
continues to milk the cum out of Jesse's cock. The dildo continues to slide in and out but now slower and gently almost
lovingly. as Jesse's orgasm begins to taper off, Evelyn finally removes her hand and the dildo from Jesse's ass. her ass
suddenly feels empty but stretched and still tingling with pleasure. Evelyn holds her hand in front of Jesse's face.
Jesse opens her eyes to see Evelyn's hand waiting there. She knows exactly what Evelyn wants and without hesitation she
begins to lick the fingers. her tongue moves methodically over each one and her lips wrap around each sucking them clean
of her cum.)


The intensity of Jessie's orgasm is overwhelming, her body convulsing as wave after wave of pleasure crashes over her.
She moans deeply, the sound raw and primal, as her cum floods over Evelyn's hand, creating a large puddle on the bench
beneath her. Her breath is ragged, her chest heaving with the effort to draw air into her lungs. Sweat has broken out on
her back, the cool air of the locker room doing little to ease the heat that radiates from her body.

Evelyn's voice is a soft, soothing murmur, her words of praise a constant refrain as she continues to milk the last of
Jessie's orgasm from her cock. "Good girl," she repeats, her voice gentle yet firm. "Such a good girl, Jessie. Look at
you, coming so beautifully for me."

The dildo continues to slide in and out of Jessie's ass, but the pace has slowed, the movements more gentle and almost
loving. The sensation is different now, the initial intensity replaced by a lingering, tingling pleasure that keeps
Jessie's body humming with aftershocks.

As Jessie's orgasm begins to taper off, Evelyn finally removes her hand and the dildo from Jessie's ass. The sudden
emptiness is stark, her body feeling both stretched and tingling with the remnants of pleasure. The cool air hits her
exposed flesh, sending a shiver down her spine.

Evelyn holds her hand in front of Jessie's face, the glistening cum coating her fingers a stark reminder of Jessie's
submission and the intensity of her orgasm. Jessie opens her eyes, her vision blurry with tears and the aftereffects of
her release. She sees Evelyn's hand waiting there, and without hesitation, she begins to lick the fingers clean.

Her tongue moves methodically over each one, her lips wrapping around the tips to suck them clean of her cum. The taste
is familiar and strangely comforting, a tangible reminder of her submission and the pleasure that comes from it. She
takes her time, ensuring that every drop is licked away, her actions a silent acknowledgment of Evelyn's control and her
own desire to please.


(when Jesse is finished with her hand, Evelyn again praises her. then grasping the back of her head gently shoves her
face down into her own cum, her nose and lips smearing into it. Jesse obediently begins to lick it up. the pressure in
the back of her head eases off so the Jesse can make sure to clean up every drop. when she's done, Evelyn tells her to
stand up. she reaches a finger over and scoops a dollop of cum off of Jesse's nose and smears it down on Jesse's lips
without needing to be prompted. Jesse licks the come from her lips and swallows it)


As Jessie finishes cleaning Evelyn's hand, she receives another round of soft praise, the words wrapping around her like
a warm embrace. "Good girl, Jessie. You're learning so well."

Evelyn's hand moves to the back of Jessie's head, her fingers tangling in her short hair. With a gentle but firm
pressure, she guides Jessie's face down into the puddle of her own cum on the bench. Jessie obeys without hesitation,
her nose and lips smearing into the sticky, white fluid. The scent is musky and familiar, a stark reminder of her own
arousal and submission.

She begins to lick it up, her tongue moving methodically to clean every drop. The pressure on the back of her head eases
slightly, allowing her to move more freely and ensure that she doesn't miss a single spot. The taste is salty and
bitter, but she swallows it down, her actions a silent acknowledgment of her role and Evelyn's control.

When she's finished, Evelyn commands her to stand up. Jessie complies, her body still trembling with the aftershocks of
her orgasm. She looks at Evelyn, awaiting her next instruction, her body glistening with sweat and cum.

Evelyn reaches a finger over and scoops a dollop of cum from Jessie's nose, smearing it across her lips. Jessie licks
the come from her lips without needing to be prompted, her tongue darting out to clean her skin. She swallows the bitter
taste, her eyes never leaving Evelyn's.

The locker room is filled with the soft sounds of their breathing, the air thick with the scent of sex and submission.
Jessie stands tall, her body on full display, her cock still semi-hard and glistening with the remnants of her orgasm.
She waits, her body ready and willing to follow whatever commands come next, her mind a whirlwind of thoughts and
emotions, all centered around her submission and the pleasure that comes from it. Evelyn watches her with an impassive
expression, her eyes taking in every detail of Jessie's body and her reactions.


(Evelyn tells Jesse to stand up and then definitely and gently resecures the chastity cage over Jesse's now soft cock.
The lot clicks into place. the sound loud and Jesse's ears. Evelyn, steps back, gives Jesse a Sharp smack on the butt,
and in a good natured voice. tells her to go shower up. after all. she's got a lot more work left to do this weekend.
Jesse goes and takes a shower luxuriating in the warmth. her mind rolling over the events of the morning. in the
previous night. She finds her hands trailing down her body and stopping at the plastic cage around her penis. She
completes the shower, dresses in her uniform and Marches down the hallway to find her next assignment. The rest of the
weekend is much less of mental. that evening she receives a harsh but quick paddle spanking for spilling a cup of tea as
she was preparing to serve it to The Master in the sitting room. her butt is stinging. she has become accustomed to her
place.)


Evelyn's voice is firm yet gentle as she instructs Jessie to stand up. Jessie complies, her body still tingling with the
aftermath of her orgasm and the lingering sensation of the dildo. Evelyn deftly and efficiently secures the chastity
cage over Jessie's now-soft cock, the click of the lock echoing loudly in the quiet locker room. The cage is a stark
reminder of her submission and the control that Evelyn and The Master hold over her.

The sound of the lock clicking into place sends a shiver down Jessie's spine, a mix of humiliation and a strange sense
of security washing over her. She knows that she is once again under their control, her body and pleasure at their
mercy.

Evelyn steps back, her eyes scanning Jessie's body one last time before delivering a sharp smack on her butt. "Go shower
up," she says, her voice good-natured but firm. "After all, you've got a lot more work left to do this weekend."

Jessie nods, her body already moving towards the shower. She steps under the warm spray, the water cascading over her
body, washing away the sweat, cum, and lube. The heat of the water is a welcome relief, soothing her muscles and helping
to clear her mind.

As she showers, Jessie's hands trail down her body, her fingers tracing the curves and lines of her form. They pause at
the chastity cage, a tangible reminder of her submission. She takes a moment to reflect on the events of the morning and
the previous night, her mind a whirlwind of sensations and emotions.

After her shower, Jessie dresses in her uniform, the fabric familiar and comforting against her skin. She marches down
the hallway, her steps confident and purposeful, ready to face whatever tasks lie ahead.

The rest of the weekend passes in a blur of menial tasks and subtle humiliations. Jessie serves meals, cleans rooms, and
attends to The Master's every need, her body aching from the physical labor and her mind numb from the constant state of
submission.


(as Jesse is to preparing to leave on Sunday evening to return to her apartment and classes the following day, Evelyn
approaches her. She tells her The Master needs to speak with her in the study before she departs. she heads down the
hallway toward the study, and Jesse obediently falls in behind her without a word. arrive at the study and The Masters
waiting behind the desk. Evelyn walks over and takes her place beside him. without needing to be told Jesse stands
before the gray desk. The Master looks her up and down a smile tagging at the corner of One lip. after a moment he

all needed arrangements. arrangements. on Friday evening A truck will arrive with workman who will load Jesse's stuff
and put it into storage for her. She need not bring anything with All she needs will be


The study is dimly lit, the warm glow of a few strategically placed lamps casting long shadows across the room. The air
is thick with the scent of old books and polished wood, the atmosphere heavy with anticipation. The Master sits behind
his imposing desk, his eyes sharp and piercing as he regards Jessie. Evelyn stands by his side, her posture rigid and
her expression inscrutable, a silent sentinel overseeing the scene.

Jessie stands before the desk, her heart pounding in her chest as she awaits The Master's words. Her uniform is crisp
and neat, her body standing at attention, a picture of obedience and submission. The Master's gaze roams over her,
taking in every detail, a small smile playing at the corner of his lip.

After a moment of silence, The Master clears his throat, his voice stern and commanding as he speaks. "Jessie, you
should enjoy this next week, because beginning Friday evening, you will be staying at the mansion permanently until your
servitude is complete. Evelyn will make all the necessary arrangements."

Jessie's breath hitches slightly at the news, her mind racing with the implications of The Master's words. Permanent
residency at the mansion means a complete and total immersion into her new life, a life of servitude and submission.
There will be no escape, no respite from the constant pressure and control.

The Master continues, his voice unyielding. "On Friday evening, a truck will arrive with workers who will load your
belongings and put them into storage for you. You need not bring anything with you. Everything you need will be provided
here."

Jessie's eyes widen slightly at the thought of strangers going through her personal belongings, but she knows better
than to protest. She nods, her voice steady as she acknowledges The Master's commands. "Yes, Master. I understand."

The Master's smile widens, his eyes gleaming with satisfaction. "Good. I am glad to hear that you understand. Your
training will continue in earnest once you are fully integrated into the household. You will learn what it truly means
to serve, to obey, and to find pleasure in submission."
