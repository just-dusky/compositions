She stood there watching him for some time, and he could feel her steady gaze on the back of his neck as he worked.

"You do nice work, Jason."

The warmth of the words caught Jason completely off guard. He had never heard Evelyn address him with anything other
than command and scorn. The words seemed to hang in the stillness of the library. Jason felt frozen in place; the
feather duster hovered above the shelf as he tried to absorb the compliment. His face flushed, and the warmth crept up
his neck and into his ears. He felt his mind scrambling for words. He needed something to say, something that would
smooth the edges of the awkwardness that seemed to dig into his chest. Nothing came to him. He glanced up at her to
find her eyes quietly exploring his own. He had to look away, but he felt her gaze penetrating his embarrassment as
if it was stripping him down to something naked and vulnerable.

"Ah," Evelyn declared. She stepped forward towards him approaching deliberately beginning to fill the space that had
been congested with awkwardness.

"The heir to a fortune, and yet...flustered by a simple compliment. I would be surprised, except..."

She paused and let the mystery of her next words shoulder out more of the unease that had captured Jason.

"I know all about you."

She watched him with a calm, almost clinical intensity. As she approached him, the scent of her perfume grew stronger.
The sharp clean aroma infused with an enigma his mind could still not unwind seemed to drive away the ancient musk of
the room and corner him against the stacks.

"There is no need for modesty here, Jason. When you are complimented, you should give thanks. I do not make idle
conversation."

Jason flushed again.

"Uhh, thank you?" he stammered out.

Evelyn's head tilted slightly, the movement so controlled it seemed almost mechanical, as if her body were made of
polished wood hinged with steel. The faintest ghost of a smile crept across her lips, but seemed to vanish as soon as he
noticed it. Jason found this even more unsettling Jason. The moment streteched on, her quiet intensity filling the space
around them. She lifted one perfectly manicured hand to press her index finger firmly against his sternum.

"Modesty is not a virtue, no matter what others may say."

Evelyn peered directly into his eyes. She lowered her chin subtly; her gaze boring deeper into him.

"People try to wear modesty like a shroud as if they could hide their true nature beneath. I see you, Jason. I
_know_ you. You are naked before me...and before The Master."

She lowered her hand and gave him a very slight nod to underscore her words. Again, Jason felt compelled to look away.
His eyes found his shabby socks again, and found himself speaking the words that felt so unusual for his privileged
mouth.

"Yes, ma'am."
