# Prelude

Jason Smith leaned over a book and his notepad at a table in the Library. He was scowling and scratching out notes in a
cramped hand. He didn't strike an impressive figure as he hunched over his studies. His red hair belied his lack of
grooming this morning, and his faded jeans and faded black screenprinted shirt seemed like he had just thrown on his
outfit from last night. He seemed quite focused though, if a little out of sorts as if his previous night had gone a
bit too late. No one that saw him would have guessed that Jason had it all.

His life was an artifice of privilege and ease. The only son of a notoriously conservative and immensely wealthy
industrialist, Jason's future was scripted from birth. After attending private school, he had gone off to college--the
same presigious university his father (and grandfather) had graduated from. After college, he would go to work at his
father's company, Smith & Radiche. After working in management for some years, he would assume a seat on the board. He
would find a suitable wife from an equally prominent family and raise a family of his own to carry on the family name
and business.

The pressure to conform and perform was immense. Jason constantly bore the weight of his destiny knowing that he would
grow up to inherit the world or "piss it all away" as his father reminded him whenever he failed. Jason learned to
escape the burden of living his father's dream through the thrashing beats of underground clubs and the transcendence
of powerful drugs--cocaine being his favorite.

Jason was brilliant; he found success in most things he undertook. His reliance on sheer intelligence, though, found him
giving up quickly at challenges he could not master immediately. Though an active and athletic man, Jason constantly
struggled with his weight. He loved food, alcohol, and drugs. His body struggled to keep up with his hedonistic
lifestile, and he never quite liked how he looked. Consequently, Jason didn't put a lot of effort into his looks. His
auburn hair always seemed a bit shaggy--shorter on the sides but long on the top and sweeping down across his brow. Jason
didn't grow much facial hair. He sometimes tried sideburns or a mustache, but they never really worked out. Usually, he
just wore a poorly groomed goatee that was even redder than his hair. Jason wasn't ruggedly handsome, but he wasnt' ugly
either. He had a bit of a softness about his face--well, about his whole body.

Unbeknownst to Jason, his life had been closely studied for some time. About 10 miles outside of the university town
where he studied stood a vast old estate. The grounds and house were immaculately maintained, though few people had ever
more than admired it from a distance. The owner of the estate was rather reclusive. No one in town really knew him. They
might recognize him, but couldn't even tell you what his voice sounded like. He was a man of vast means and
seemed--judging by the enthusiastic attendance of the soires he hosted regularly--also a man of obscure influence. He
was rumored to be an avid collector of unique... acquisitions. He had taken an interest in the rebellious heir. Seeing
not just a wealthy young man but a canvas of repressed desires and vulnerability, he set his plans in motion. He
directed a discreet surveillance operation that captured every moment of Jason's double life. The ecstatic dancing, the
illicit substances, the occasional intimate moments he shared with women far below his station: all were compiled into a
growing dossier of damning evidence. He had even been photographed on a few drug-fueled occasions to spend some rather
intimate moments in the company of men. Though he had not been caught, yet, in any sexual acts with the same sex, there
were a series of photographs clearly showing him dancing closely and even kissing some young men.

As Jason tried to shake off his hangover and study that Wednesday morning, he was approached by an agent of the
enigmatic tycoon. A tall woman bearing a black leather briefcase strode up his table. She stood nearly six feet tall.
She was slender but not slight, and her face and body had an angular aspect that was as striking as the crisp black
business suit she wore. Beneath the knee-length straight black skirt, she wore a pair of smart black leather pumps with
heels that were nearly tall enough to be unprofessional. She did not sit down, but stood near with her hand resting on
the varnished oak. Her deep dark eyes bore into his as he looked up to see who had approached. Her thick black hair was
pulled back into a tight bun, her eyes were framed by light rectangular frames. The only jewelry she wore was a simple
thin silver chain with an ornate, sparkling silver padlock hanging near the hollow of her throat.

Just as Jason was about to ask how he could help the imposing woman out, she began to speak. Her voice was cool and
hard. It betrayed no anxiety, but neither was it emotionless. She sounded confident, commanding, and just slightly
amused.

"I am Evelyn. I serve as majordomo to the Master. You are Jason Smith."

These were not questions, but plain statements of fact. Jason furrowed his brow wondering just who "The Master" was and
what the hell a majordomo even did. He also found himself wondering just how this woman knew _him_. He was just about to
demand that she explain who she was to him when Evelyn cut him off.

"We have been observing you for some time. For a man blessed with so much opportunity, you carry yourself quite
carelessly."

She precisely set her briefcase on the table, opened it briskly and withdrew a red three-ring-binder. It seemed to
Jason--who's academic life had made him quite practiced in evaluating such things--that it was a two inch binder with
about an inch of documents in it. Nothing was written on the cover, but Evelyn abruptly lifted the cover to reveal a
title card that said:

> Jason Smith: Servitude

Jason scowled at the page and turned the scowl up to meet Evelyn's unfliching gaze.

"Just what the fuck is this?" Jason lashed out. "Who _the fuck_ are you?"

Evelyn was unperturbed by either his anger or his profanity.

"I already introduced myself. I will not waste time repeating things for your benefit."

She flipped the title card over to reveal a section divider with word "Collateral". She left the binder open to that
page just long enough for Jason to read the word, and before he could protest, flipped it over.

A full page color photograph showed Jason looking up into the camera. His eyes were glassy and bloodshot. He was
flushed, and his nostril and lip had a light dusting of white powder. Below his face, his hand lingered over a mirror
holding a rolled up $100 bill. The mirror bore traces of powder near his hand, and another thick line of powder waited
nearby. Jason was smiling mischieviously at the photographer. The photograph was clearly taken in a grimy club
restroom--graffitti drawn with black permanent markers covered one pink wall. The photograph seemed to state, as boldly
as the word "CUNT" scrawled in thick black letters on the wall that Jason was a degenerate cokehead.

Evelyn let Jason soak in the image. His face was draining of color, and his hand that had been writing notes before was
now wrapped in a white-knuckled death grip around the pen. She flipped to the next page.

Jason shirtless and glistening with sweat. He was dancing _very_ close with a rather fetching young man who was
kissing his neck and pulling Jason closer with a hand gripped tightly to his butt cheek.

_Flip_

Jason passed out in a booth of a low-grade diner. His shirt was soaked with sweat, his hair disheveled, and a woman in
a cheap revealing party dress sat across the table from him. She was laughing up at the cameraperson, but her eyes were
weary and sunken, her skin a little too gray and and weathered for a girl of her age.

_Flip_

Jason smoking a cigarette at a table covered with empty bottles. He was surrounded by other young people that had clearly
just come from a party or some such. He seemed to be making an emphatic guesture toward one of the men with the hand
holding the cigarette. His black shirt was decorated with an etching of an airstream camper and a stick person you might
see on a bathroom sign. Beneath the picture it declared, "White Trash".

_Flip_

Jason naked in bed with a disheveled woman.

Jason squinting and smoking a blunt with some shady characters.

_Flip_

Jason again dancing with another man. He was facing away from the man; seemingly caught in a passionate grind against
the mans crotch. Jason was smiling with his eyes closed, and his tight black pants were clearly displaying a straining
erection.

Evelyn left the binder open to this picture. She paused for effect, and as Jason's haunted eyes turned up to look at
her, she addressed him again.

"Your father loathes drugs and people that use them. He is notorious for sponsoring narcotics policing in the city. He
donates to politicians with strong anti-drug messaging. Your father detests 'the fivolity of undirected youths'. He does
not drink, and condemns those that do. You were not allowed to attend dances growing up, and your friends were carefully
filtered for any questionable characters. But, above all, your father _hates_ homosexuality. He has stated publicly that
'the gays' are a blight on America, that they should be reformed or driven out, and that he will _not_ tolerate
homosexuality within his 'sphere of influence'. These are matters of public record."

Again, she let her words hang in the air as the picture on the table underscored her meaning. Jason felt his throat
tighten and saliva fill his mouth. He felt a coldness in his stomach. His feet were sweating. He liked his dry lips and
cleared his throat.

"So...what do you _want_?"

Evelyn smirked at him, her eyes glittering.

"What _I_ want doesn't matter. What _The Master_ wants will become quite clear to you in time. You will report to the
estate Saturday at 07:00. You will not ask questions. You will not be late. You will do as you are told. If you fail,
your father will receive the contents of this binder which include these and more photographs as well as timelines,
receipts, and attestations. You will lose everything, Jason...unless you _obey_."

Before Jason could react to this last statement, Evelyn suddenly snapped the binder closed. From the briefcase, she
extracted a business card with only an address on it and leaned over to place it before Jason.

"Seven o'clock, Saturday", she said sharply.

She stood back up, closed the briefcase around the incriminating binder, and turned away. Her movements were precise
and smooth as strode out of the library leaving Jason agape. His mind whirled and he found that he was gripping the
edge of the table in a death grip.

"What the _fuck_ just happened?"
