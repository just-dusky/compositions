# Chapter 1 - Servitude

The massive oak door of the mansion swung open before Jason could even raise his hand to the brass knocker. Evelyn stood
there, silhouetted against the grand foyer's dim light. She was again as severe and polished as she was on campus when
she first confronted him. She wore wearing a tailored charcoal pantsuit that accentuated her lean, angular frame. As
before, her expression was unreadable aside from a slight smirk that seemed to tug at the corners of her mouth and the
light in her eyes.

"You are punctual. Good." Her voice was cool and measured as she nodded with approval. She stepped to the side and looked
into the foyer. Her guesture articulated a command to enter as clearly as words. The foyer was cavernous. The floor was
tiled with highly glossed marble squares of immense size. Near the door was a dark wooden desk adorned with an antique
lamp, a silver pen, and a notepad. There were a few ornate wooden chairs nearby and a shelf with an assortment of shoes
on them. Jason noticed that there were sneakers, dress shoes, and clogs available in both men's and woemen's styles. In
all, about ten pairs were waiting. As Jason wheeled around to take in the impressive room, his own sneakers squeaked
awkwardly on the polished floor.

"Leave those. You wouldn't be needing them."

Jason bent to remove his shoes and placed them on the shelf. He glanced down and scowled at his right foot where his
toe was pushing at a small hole in his dingy white sock. Evelyn looked down at his feet and frowned, though she didn't
say a word. Jason felt the judgement and became aware that his face was turning a little red.

Evelyn interrupted his shame by handing him a single sheet of heavy, cream-colored paper.

"Your tasks for the day. Dusting the library, polishing the silver in the dining room, and ensuring the solarium plants
are watered. I will inspect your work periodically. Attention to detail is not a suggestion."

Jason stared at the page, his eyes not really seeing the words. What the hell was happening here. He was going to do
chores for these people? If there was one thing that Jason Smith did _not_ do, it was fucking chores. He looked up at
her and opened his mouth to let her know just how ridiculous this all was, but before he could say one word, Evelyn
barked out a single word.

"NO."

Jason closed his mouth and recoiled just a bit.

"Nothing has changed since Tuesday, Mr. Smith. The rules stand. Do as you are told, or the file is sent to your father."

She looked sharply at him appraising his response. Jason tried to meet her eyes but his mind flickered back to the
damnable folder and the evidence it contained that would surely ruin him. He looked down at the floor.

"Fine."

Evelyn's hand snapped out to cup his chin and lift it so that he was looking into her eyes again.

"Yes. Ma'am. You will reply with 'yes, ma'am'. Do you understand?"

Jason's eyes blazed, but the binder nagged at the back of his mind. The silence stretched on, but Evelyn's gaze did not
falter. Finally, Jason relented.

"Yes _ma'am_."

She nodded once and lowered her hand.

"Good."

"The Master is occupied today, so you will report directly to me. Complete your tasks in a timely manner. Do not wander.
Do not touch anything that is not on your list."

Abruptly, Evelyn turned away and strode out of the foyer and down a hall. The clicking of her heels faded as she receeded
into the huge house. Jason idly wondered why _she_ got to wear shoes inside while he had to slide around in his dirty
socks. He looked again at the list clutched in his hand:

> Saturday tasks:
>
> - Dust the library
> - Polish the silver (dining room only)
> - Water solarium plants

This was going to be a weird day.

----

Jason found the library to be a room of contradictions. It was vast but cramped. It seemed so still, yet it was humming
with a strange energy. The air seemed stale, yet it was spiced with the earthy tones of old leather, ink, and wood oil.
Jason approached the large desk by the door carefully as if any abrupt movements might wake the souls of the sleeping
authors entombed here. On the center of the desk was a feather duster, a few clean rags, a can of furniture oil, and a
black waist apron hemmed in lace. Jason's eyebrow shot up.

"Well, I'm not wearing _that_", he murmered to himself. He picked up the cleaning tools and approached the first stack.
As he busied himself dusting the bindings and tops of the books and oiling the wood, he took in the titles on the
covers. It seemed he had started in some sort of history section. The titles were dull and scholarly, but the books were
beautiful. They must all be antiques; printings from no later than the 19th century.

As he worked, the silence set in around him, and the only sounds that filled his ear were the soft hiss of the duster
and the occasional creak of the rich oaken floorboards beneath his stocking feet.

Somehow, Evelyn had entered the library without a sound. Jason only became aware that she was there watching him when
the scent of her perfume reached his nose. It was crisp and clean with a subtle undertone that tickled at his mind like
a name that he couldn't quite remember. Against the ancient aroma of the room, it struck him like a slap. He whirled to
find her standing just inside the doorway, her arms folded across her chest as she observed him working.

"Methodical," she remarked.

Jason turned back to look at his work as if to confirm her assertion. When he looked back to Evelyn he found that she
had turned to look at the desk.

"One can't do good work, however, without the proper tools of the trade."

She turned back to look at him expectantly.

"The apron?" he asked incredulously. "Yeah...I don't need _that_."

"I'll be the arbiter of your needs when you are here, Mr. Smith."

Her words left no room for argument. Jason's protests stuck in his throat and he swallowed them back down.

"Fine," he grumbled.

Evelyn's eyebrow shot up and her face hardened. Suddenly, Jason understood his error.

"I mean, yes ma'am."

Evelyn nodded curtly.

"Good. Don the apron and continue, Mr. Smith."

She made no move to leave, so Jason approached the table and picked up the apron. He wrapped it around his front and
then began struggling to tie it behind his back. As he worked, he looked at the lace and thought it looked absurd next
to his worn jeans. After fumbling at the knot for a bit, he heard Evelyn's heels as she approached and felt her hands
grasp the apron strings.

As she briskly tied a knot, she scolded him.

"You'll need to learn to tie a bow, Mr. Smith. This will not be the only time you need to wear such things."

Her words seemed to hint that he would be wearing _more_ weird clothes as he worked here. He rolled his eyes--a safe
guesture since he was facing away from her--and decided to just get the fucking day over with. When he felt that she was
finished, he turned to face her. Her face was a paradoxical mask of detachment and expectation. She waited quietly until
Jason got the hint and returned to work.

She stood there watching him for some time, and he could feel her steady gaze on the back of his neck as he worked.

"You do nice work, Jason."

The warmth of the words caught Jason completely off guard. He had never heard Evelyn address him with anything other
than command and scorn. The words seemed to hang in the stillness of the library. Jason felt frozen in place; the
feather duster hovered above the shelf as he tried to absorb the compliment. His face flushed, and the warmth crept up
his neck and into his ears. He felt his mind scrambling for words. He needed something to say, something that would
smooth the edges of the awkwardness that seemed to dig into his chest. Nothing came to him. He glanced up at her to
find her eyes quietly exploring his own. He had to look away, but he felt her gaze penetrating his embarrassment as
if it was stripping him down to something naked and vulnerable.

"Ah," Evelyn declared. She stepped forward towards him deliberately beginning to fill the space that had been congested
with awkwardness.

"The heir to a fortune, and yet...flustered by a simple compliment. I would be surprised, except..."

She paused and let the mystery of her next words shoulder out more of the unease that had captured Jason.

"I know all about you."

She watched him with a calm, almost clinical intensity. As she approached him, the scent of her perfume grew stronger.
The sharp clean aroma infused with an enigma his mind could still not unwind seemed to drive away the ancient musk of
the room and corner him against the stacks.

"There is no need for modesty here, Jason. When you are complimented, you should give thanks. I do not make idle
conversation."

Jason flushed again.

"Uhh, thank you?" he stammered out.

Evelyn's head tilted slightly, the movement so controlled it seemed almost mechanical, as if her body were made of
polished wood hinged with steel. The faintest ghost of a smile crept across her lips, but seemed to vanish as soon as he
noticed it. Jason found this even more unsettling. The moment streteched on, her quiet intensity filling the space
around them. She lifted one perfectly manicured hand to press her index finger firmly against his sternum.

"Modesty is not a virtue, no matter what others may say."

Evelyn peered directly into his eyes. She lowered her chin subtly; her gaze boring deeper into him.

"People try to wear modesty like a shroud as if they could hide their true nature beneath. I see you, Jason. I
_know_ you. You are naked before me...and before The Master."

She lowered her hand and gave him a very slight nod to underscore her words. Again, Jason felt compelled to look away.
His eyes found his shabby socks again, and found himself speaking the words that felt so unusual on his privileged
lips.

"Yes, ma'am."

_Continue here_

Jason's eyes flickered over Evelyn's frame—unbidden, unguarded. He noticed the subtle curve of her shoulders beneath the
crisp lines of her coat, the way her posture was rigid, but her hips tilted just so when she turned, a hint of softness
hidden in the geometry of control. Her hair, low and parted, fell just so in front of her ears, and the scent of her
perfume, so clean and cold, lingered in the air like a promise. His gaze lingered for a heartbeat too long, and it was
not lost on her.

Evelyn stopped mid‑step, her hand hovering above a mahogany bookshelf. The room held its breath. For a moment, she did
not speak, only watched Jason through the faintest lowering of her lashes, as if she had seen this before—felt this, in
fact, when she was younger, less sure, and just as lost in the weight of his own body. She knew the power of a gaze, the
way it could be both a weapon and a plea. She also knew how to twist it into something else entirely.

"You seemed distracted, Jason," she said.


I snapped my eyes back up to her face. I cleared my throat nervously, and abruptly returned to dusting. As I continued
my work, I truthfully explained that I was feeling a bit overwhelmed.


Evelyn stepped closer, her presence shifting the air like a shadow before the sun. She stopped just behind Jason, her
gaze not on him, but on the duster in his hand, the way his knuckles were white from the grip. Her breath was steady,
measured, as if she had practiced even this—her silence, her stillness—until it felt like a performance. The faint scent
of her perfume tightened around him, crisp and unyielding, as if it was meant to clear his thoughts or perhaps strip
them down to something rawer.

"Overwhelmed," she mused, the word soft but deliberate. "By what, exactly?" She moved slightly to the left, just enough
to block the window from his view, cutting the room into a dim, cloistered space. Her tone was smooth, but there was
weight behind it, like a question she already knew the answer to. The floorboards creaked under her weight, and she
placed a hand gently on the back of the chair at the reading desk, her fingers brushing the wood as if testing its
grain.

Jason's voice was quiet, uncertain.


I attempted a small, awkward chuckle and continued dusting more vigorously.


Evelyn watched him for a moment longer, her eyes lingering on the way his shoulders tensed and his motions grew stiffer,
almost frantic. She didn't move, but the room felt smaller now—as if the walls were closing in around his unease. A
faint, almost imperceptible sigh escaped her lips, the sound so soft it could be mistaken for the wind through the
library's tall windows. She stepped to the side, her fingers brushing the spine of a heavy leather‑bound book, and
tilted her head slightly as if listening to something only she could hear.

"You know," she said, her voice even, but laced with a quiet amusement, "The Master does not tolerate excessive energy.
He finds it inefficient." She turned then, her movements as precise as a clock's, and walked slowly back toward the
doorway, her heels tapping softly on the floor. "Save your strength. You would need it later."

The door clicked softly behind her as she exited, leaving Jason alone once more.
